This is Cycle APPENDIX-B (AB); you are the Author, guided by the **IMPORTANT PROMPT: Authorial Specification (Preamble) for Generation NINE (9)**.

Take a deep breath. Take your time. Seek maximal completeness, correctness, and authenticity.

Your task is to perform the final syntactic and polish revision of Appendix B, "The Complete Formula Reference."

**Critical Context:** This appendix is a high-density, high-value reference. Its primary purpose is utility and correctness. The content is already excellent and comprehensive. Apply the Diminishing Returns Principle rigorously—this section requires pedantic attention to detail, not creative rewriting.

**Pre-Catalog of Technical Details to Preserve:**
- All LaTeX formulas must be preserved exactly as written.
- All stated constraints, properties, and computational notes associated with each formula.
- The organizational structure: Conformal Embeddings, Geometric Relationships, Transformations, Intersections, etc.
- All specific tables and their contents, such as the "Common Intersection Results" table.

**Specific Generation 9 Tasks for This Cycle:**

**De-confabulation Requirements:**
- This chapter is a formula reference and is already free of confabulated experience claims. Verify this remains the case. No specific actions are expected.

**Global Consistency Verification:**
- **Terminology Check:** Ensure terms like "IPNS," "OPNS," "rotor," "motor," "versor," "bivector," and "pseudoscalar" are used in a manner consistent with their definitions in the main body of the text.
- **Notation Check:** This is the highest priority for this cycle. Meticulously verify that every mathematical symbol in every formula and description adheres to the global standard.
  - All vectors in prose (e.g., "**n**" in the Plane Representation description) must be bolded.
  - Verify every instance of a basis vector like $\mathbf{n}_0$ or $\mathbf{n}_\infty$ is correctly formatted in LaTeX.
  - Ensure norms are consistently represented as $\|\cdot\|$.
- **Markdown Normalization:** Ensure all bulleted lists use the `-` character.

**Transition Perfection:**
- This is an appendix; it does not require narrative transitions to or from other chapters. The introductory sentence should simply and clearly state its purpose as a reference.

**Hybrid Architecture Contribution:**
- This appendix supports the hybrid architecture by providing the precise formulas needed to build the "Interface Layer" that converts between GA representations and traditional forms. No changes are needed to reinforce this; its utility is self-evident.

**Multi-Agent Artifact Scan:**
- This section is a list of formulas and is less susceptible to multi-agent artifacts like repeated explanations. Verify that each formula is presented once in the most logical location.

**Error Catalog:**
- **Math Notation:** In the "Point Extraction (Conformal to Euclidean)" section, the formula `P · n∞ = -1` uses a Unicode `∞` symbol. It MUST be converted to the LaTeX command `$\mathbf{n}_\infty$`.
- **Grammar/Clarity:** In the "Rotation by Angle θ" section, the formula `$X' = RXR^{-1} = RX\tilde{R}$` is correct, but adding a note explicitly stating "for unit rotors" to the second equality would improve clarity.
- **Consistency:** In "Point-to-Plane Distance," the text says the denominator is `-1` for normalized points, then gives an alternative form `d = P · π` "when P is normalized." These seem contradictory. The second one should likely read `d = P · π` for a normalized point *and* a normalized plane where `P · n_inf` is `-1`. Clarify this to be unambiguous.
- **Completeness:** In the "Motor Decomposition" section, the extraction of the translation part is vague ("Extract from $M\tilde{R}$"). While keeping it brief, add the specific formula: $T = (M\tilde{R})$. This provides a complete reference.

**Chapter-Specific Refinements:**
- In the "Uniform Scaling from Origin" section, the formula `$D = \frac{1 + s}{2} + \frac{1 - s}{2}\mathbf{n}_0\mathbf{n}_\infty$` is an excellent practical form. Add a comment clarifying that `$s$` is the scale factor.
- In the "Linear Point Interpolation" section, the formula has `(1-t)P_0 + tP_1` in the denominator norm. It should correctly be `\|(1-t)P_0 + tP_1\|`. The norm `||` is missing. Correct the LaTeX.

**Performance Honesty Check:**
- This section is a formula reference, not a performance analysis. Its purpose is to state the "what," not the "how fast." The existing "computational notes" are sufficient. No changes required.

**Diminishing Returns Assessment:**
Before making substantial changes, analyze whether this chapter has achieved near-optimal state. If fewer than 20 lines require modification, provide a full deconstruction explaining why the chapter succeeds as-is. Include:
- Why the structure is logical and useful for a practitioner.
- How the selection of formulas covers the most critical use cases.
- Where the brief descriptions provide sufficient context without bloating the reference.
- A specific recommendation for minimal, pedantic changes only.

Remember: Every edit must serve the goal of creating a wiser, more capable practitioner. Favor understanding of intent over literal interpretation. This is the final opportunity to perfect this chapter.
