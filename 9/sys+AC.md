This is Cycle APPENDIX-C (AC); you are the Author, guided by the **IMPORTANT PROMPT: Authorial Specification (Preamble) for Generation NINE (9)**.

Take a deep breath. Take your time. Seek maximal completeness, correctness, and authenticity.

Your task is to perform the final syntactic and polish revision of Appendix C, "Multiplication and Reference Tables."

**[END STANDARD OPENING]**

**Critical Context:** This appendix is a pure reference section. Its value lies in its absolute correctness, clarity, and consistency. It has undergone eight generations of refinement and is likely near-optimal. Apply the Diminishing Returns Principle rigorouslyâ€”unnecessary changes risk introducing errors. The primary task is pedantic verification and normalization.

**Pre-Catalog of Technical Details to Preserve:**
- All metric signatures in the "Common Geometric Algebras" table.
- All entries in the geometric product tables for 2D and 3D Euclidean algebras (Tables C.1, C.2, C.3).
- All results in the Conformal Basis Products tables (C.4, C.5).
- All grade dimensions and basis blade counts in the Grade Structure tables (C.6, C.7).
- The binary indexing scheme for 5D CGA (Table C.8).
- The sign computation rules and examples (Table C.9).
- All pseudoscalar properties and duality mappings (Tables C.10, C.11).
- The bivector commutator table for $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ (Table C.12).
- The Quaternion-GA correspondence, including the verification of Hamilton's relation (Table C.13).
- All computational complexity analyses in Table C.14.

**Specific Generation 9 Tasks for This Cycle:**

**De-confabulation Requirements:**
- This chapter is pure reference and should contain no confabulated experience. Verify this is the case. No changes are expected.

**Global Consistency Verification:**
- **Terminology Check:** Ensure that basis blades are consistently notated as $\mathbf{e}_{12}$, not $\mathbf{e}_1\mathbf{e}_2$ or $\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2$ within the tables themselves, to maintain visual clarity and compactness. The introductory text can explain the equivalence. Verify the CGA pseudoscalar is consistently written as $I_c$.
- **Notation Check:** Perform a meticulous check to ensure every single mathematical symbol is a LaTeX-formatted entity. For example, ensure all basis vectors like $\mathbf{e}_1$ are correctly formatted as `$\mathbf{e}_1$` and all bivectors like $\mathbf{e}_{12}$ are formatted as `$\mathbf{e}_{12}$`. The multiplication symbol in the table headers should be `$\times$`.
- **Markdown Normalization:** Verify that all 14 tables use correct and consistent GitHub-flavored Markdown formatting. Check column alignment and header separators (`|---|`).

**Transition Perfection:**
- This is an appendix; it does not require narrative transitions. The brief introductory sentence is sufficient.

**Hybrid Architecture Contribution:**
- This appendix supports the entire book's argument by providing the concrete, low-level computational details that an engineer would need to implement the algorithms discussed, including any hybrid systems. Its role is purely foundational.

**Multi-Agent Artifact Scan:**
- Check for any conflicting or redundant definitions that may have crept in. For example, in Table C.3, ensure the note about $\mathbf{e}_{31}$ vs $\mathbf{e}_{13}$ is clear and doesn't contradict usage elsewhere. In Table C.10, verify the CGA pseudoscalar definition matches its usage in Table C.7.

**Error Catalog:**
- **Spelling:** Scan for any typographical errors.
- **Grammar:** The text is minimal, but check for clarity. For example, the note in Table C.3 "$\mathbf{e}_{31} = \mathbf{e}_{13}$ with appropriate sign" is slightly ambiguous. Rephrase to "Note: $\mathbf{e}_{ji} = -\mathbf{e}_{ij}$ for $i < j$."
- **Math Notation:** In Table C.4, the "Mixed" type entries `$-1 + \mathbf{n}_0 \wedge \mathbf{n}_\infty$` are correct but could be confusing. Verify they are consistent with the book's core definitions.
- **Tables:** In Table C.8, the "Sign Computation" column is not filled out and is somewhat misleading. Remove this column entirely as the sign depends on the operation, not the blade itself.
- **Tables:** In Table C.10, the formula for the dual in CGA can be ambiguous depending on the pseudoscalar's properties. Given $I_c^2$ is likely negative in the book's chosen signature, the formula should be consistent. The table gives $A^* = -AI$ for a 5D space with $I^2=-1$. Verify this matches the main text's definition ($A^* = AI_c^{-1} = A(-I_c) = -AI_c$). The table seems correct, but this is a critical point of consistency to verify.
- **Tables:** The basis elements for CGA in Table C.7 should explicitly list the Euclidean vectors as $\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3$ and the null vectors as, for instance, $\mathbf{e}_+, \mathbf{e}_-$ from which $\mathbf{n}_0, \mathbf{n}_\infty$ are constructed, or be consistent with the Notation guide. The current listing is correct but assumes prior context. Cross-reference with the Notation guide and ensure perfect consistency.
- **Tables:** The final entry in Table C.14 "Grade projection" optimized complexity should be $O(\binom{n}{k})$ which is correct, but could be clarified as "where k is the target grade".

**Diminishing Returns Assessment:**
Before making substantial changes, analyze whether this appendix has achieved a near-optimal state. If fewer than 20 lines require modification, provide a full deconstruction explaining why the chapter succeeds as-is. Include:
- Why the table structures are clear and comprehensive
- How the technical content is correct and serves its reference purpose
- What makes the appendix a valuable tool for a practitioner
- A specific recommendation for only the minimal, pedantic changes listed above.

Remember: Every edit must serve the goal of creating a wiser, more capable practitioner. Favor understanding of intent over literal interpretation. This is the final opportunity to perfect this chapter.
