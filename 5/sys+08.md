Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Chapter Eight, "Computational Geometry Transformed: Algorithms Reimagined Through GA." This chapter marks a pivotal transition in the manuscript, moving from the theoretical elegance of the conformal model to its concrete, algorithmic power. It must serve as the first resounding "proof" that the journey through the preceding chapters was worth it. The tone should shift from foundational to demonstrative, showcasing with confidence how GA systematically solves the "fragmentation crisis" outlined in Chapter 1.

Begin by explicitly framing this chapter as the direct answer to the problems posed at the start of the book. The reader, having just internalized the `meet` operation in Chapter 7, should now see it unleashed as the promised "Universal Intersection Algorithm." For each classic intersection problem presented—line-plane, sphere-sphere, three planes—structure the narrative to first evoke the complexity of the traditional, case-ridden approach, and then reveal the stunning simplicity and universality of the GA `meet` operation. The contrast should be dramatic and compelling.

When discussing more complex geometric structures like Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations, the focus must be on revealing the deep geometric insight that GA provides. It's not enough to show that the formulas work; you must explain *why* they take such a simple form. Emphasize that the perpendicular bisector between two sites is not something to be calculated with midpoints and normals; in conformal space, it *is* simply the difference vector between the two conformal points. The algebra is the geometry. Acknowledge with nuance that while a highly specialized traditional algorithm might be faster for a simple case, the GA approach wins on generality, robustness, and its effortless extension to higher dimensions or more complex primitives like spheres (for power diagrams).

A central theme of this chapter must be **robustness through algebraic honesty**. Refine the explanations of how GA handles degeneracies. When traditional methods fail with a division by zero, the `meet` operation does not. It gracefully produces a result of a different grade—a line at infinity, a tangent point—that correctly and truthfully represents the geometric reality of the situation. The special cases are no longer special; they are natural, algebraic consequences.

Finally, the section on implementation architecture serves as a crucial bridge to the deep dive in Chapter 15. Frame it as such—a preview of the engineering principles required to turn these elegant algorithms into performant code. Touch upon the importance of exploiting sparsity and creating specialized dispatch routines, assuring the reader that the framework's power is not merely theoretical but computationally practical. This chapter must leave the reader convinced that the promise of unification is not only real but meaningfully useful.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+08.md` for **Cycle 8** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
