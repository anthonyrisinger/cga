Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Appendix A, "Symbol and Notation Glossary." This appendix is not a postscript; it is the Rosetta Stone of the entire manuscript. Every reader, from the novice to the expert, will rely on it for clarity and confidence. Your mission is to ensure it is flawless, intuitive, and serves as a powerful pedagogical tool in its own right, perfectly reflecting the book's core philosophy of unifying algebra and geometry.

Begin by ensuring absolute, unerring consistency. Every symbol defined herein must match its usage in every chapter and every other appendix. This is a meticulous cross-referencing task that guarantees the book speaks with a single, unambiguous voice.

Elevate the tables beyond mere definitions. Infuse them with the geometric intuition that is the hallmark of this work. For the "Fundamental Operations" table, do not settle for an alphabetical list. Re-architect it functionally. Group the operations by their geometric purpose: those that measure and project, like the inner product; those that construct and span, like the outer product; and those that transform and compose, like the universal geometric product. This reframing transforms the table from a dictionary into a functional toolkit, guiding the reader to the right tool for the geometric task at hand.

In the "Geometric Objects in CGA" table, the duality between OPNS and IPNS must be crystal clear. Refine the "Incidence Test" column to tell a story. For an OPNS object like a line, the test `P ∧ L = 0` signifies that the point `P` adds no new volume, meaning it is already *part of* the line's fundamental construction. For an IPNS object like a plane, the test `P · π = 0` signifies that the point `P` *satisfies* the plane's defining constraint. This distinction is the heart of geometric duality; make it explicit.

For the "Transformations (Versors)" table, the central theme is unity. Ensure the presentation makes it obvious that one single pattern—the sandwich product—is the universal mechanism of transformation. The only thing that changes is the versor itself. The table should celebrate this incredible simplification.

Finally, imbue the descriptions for the "Special Operations and Relations" with life. The reverse is not just a symbol reversal; it is the geometric analogue of a matrix transpose. The dual is the algebraic bridge between an object and its orthogonal complement, the operator that translates between the languages of construction and constraint. Every definition should be an opportunity for insight. Make this appendix the firm bedrock upon which the reader's entire understanding is built.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+AA.md` for **Cycle AA** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
