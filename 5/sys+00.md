Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on high-level ice-breaking openers, "Preface & Notation at a Glance",  for the manuscript entitled "The Shape of One", with title and subtitle. This is not merely a proofreading pass; it is a deep synthesis to ensure this front matter acts as a perfect overture, establishing the authority, elegance, and core philosophy of the entire work. Every word and every table must be imbued with the book's central theme of unification.

Begin by contemplating the title, "The Shape of One." This is the philosophical anchor. Ensure the preface flows from this concept, subtly reinforcing the idea that we are moving from a fragmented world of many tools to a unified world of one all-encompassing framework. The subtitle, "A Unified Framework for Computation and Physics," is a direct promise to the reader. Your polish must ensure that the subsequent notation guide immediately begins to deliver on that promise with clarity and power.

The "Notation at a Glance" section is the reader's first direct contact with the algebra. It must be more than a glossary; it must emanate concise pedagogy. Your primary responsibility here is to infuse the algebraic symbols with their deep geometric meaning. For each table, evaluate whether the descriptions provide not just a definition, but an intuition. The journey from a scalar to a vector to a general multivector should be framed as a conceptual ascent from pure magnitude to a directed segment to a rich, composite entity capable of representing not just points, but entire geometric objects and the operations that transform them.

Re-envision the table of "Fundamental Operations" not as a static list of tools, but as a functional toolkit. The structure should teach the reader how to *think* with the algebra. Group the operations by their essential geometric purpose: those that **construct** and expand dimension, like the outer product; those that **measure** and contract dimension, like the inner product; and the primary operation that **composes and transforms**, the geometric product itself.

The definition that follows this table, `ab = a·b + a∧b`, is the Rosetta Stone of this entire work. It must be presented as such—a clean, prominent, and foundational identity from which all the power of the framework flows. Its visual presentation and descriptive context should be flawless, marking it as the central axiom of our new language.

Finally, conduct a rigorous consistency audit of every symbol and definition in this section, ensuring it aligns perfectly with the extensive material developed in all subsequent chapters and appendices. This is the reader's alphabet. It must be learned once and trusted completely. The polished preface must feel authoritative yet accessible, dense with information yet light to the touch, inspiring in the reader a sense of confidence that they are about to learn a language that is not just new, but true.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+00.md` for **Cycle 0** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
