Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Chapter Sixteen, "Architectural Blueprints: Systems Built with GA." This chapter is the capstone of the entire manuscript, where all preceding theory, algorithms, and philosophy converge into concrete, large-scale application. Its success is critical to the book's ultimate impact. Given its substantial length and complexity, your focus must be on synthesis, coherence, and the explicit articulation of the architectural principles it demonstrates.

This chapter presents three distinct worlds—Physics, Vision, and Robotics. Your primary directive is to ensure they feel as if they were built from a single, unified blueprint. The language, notation, and core geometric operations must be ruthlessly consistent across all three projects. The reader must see the `Motor`, the `meet` operation, and the `sandwich product` as universal tools, solving analogous problems in completely different domains. Seek out and enhance these moments of cross-domain resonance.

For each of the three design projects, you must perfect its individual narrative while strengthening its connection to the whole. Begin each project by starkly framing the "before"—the fragmented, special-cased architecture of the traditional approach. Then, unveil the GA-based architecture not as a mere replacement, but as a fundamental re-imagining. Emphasize the shift from component-based thinking (separate vectors for force, torque, velocity) to holistic geometric-object thinking (a single `Wrench` bivector, a single `Pose` motor).

In the Physics Engine, ensure the theme of "universal collision via the meet operation" is crystal clear. In the Vision System, elevate the concept of the `GEOMETRIC_FEATURE`, showing how GA allows for richer data primitives that carry their geometry with them through the pipeline. For the Robot Control architecture, the `Motor` is the protagonist of the story; refine the text so that every aspect, from forward kinematics to inverse kinematics to path planning, is explicitly shown to be a different facet of the Motor's properties.

After polishing each individual project, your final and most important task for this chapter is to synthesize the meta-lesson. Extract the universal architectural patterns that these projects reveal. Explicitly call out principles like "Unified State Representation," "Elimination of Translation Layers," and "Structure-Preserving Operations." Conclude the chapter with a powerful summary that makes it clear to the reader that Geometric Algebra doesn't just offer better algorithms; it offers a better way to *architect* geometric software. This chapter must be the ultimate proof of the book's central thesis, demonstrating not just how to build things *with* GA, but how to *think* with it.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+16.md` for **Cycle 16** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
