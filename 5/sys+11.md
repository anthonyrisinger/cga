Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Chapter Eleven, "Physics Unified: From Spinors to Spacetime." This chapter represents the intellectual summit of the entire manuscript. Its claims carry the most weight, and therefore its execution must be the most precise. The goal is not merely to show that physics can be written in the language of Geometric Algebra, but to convince the reader that this is its one true native tongue. Every sentence must work towards replacing mathematical coincidence with geometric necessity.

Begin with the unification of electromagnetism. Treat this section as the opening argument in a grand proof—it must be clear, elegant, and undeniable. The transition from Maxwell's four disparate vector equations to the single, compact bivector equation `∇F = J` must feel less like a notational trick and more like the revealing of a truth that was hidden in plain sight.

When you address Special Relativity, your focus must be on translating the abstract, index-heavy language of tensor calculus into the tangible, coordinate-free language of geometric objects. Emphasize that the spacetime interval emerges directly from the geometric square of an event vector. Show that Lorentz transformations, often presented as complex matrix operations, are nothing more than rotations in the hyperbolic planes of spacetime, perfectly handled by the same versor mechanism we have used all along. Make the connection between the light cone of relativity and the null cone of the conformal model explicit; they are sister structures encoding the fundamental constraints of their respective domains.

Your highest priority in this chapter is the demystification of quantum spin. The central message must be delivered with the force of revelation: **a spinor is a rotor.** A quantum state is not an abstract complex vector; it is a real geometric operator, an instruction for rotation. Quantum phase is the angle of that rotation. The imaginary unit `$i$` is the bivector representing the plane of measurement. Frame the traditional complex formalism as a clever but ultimately obscuring projection of this deeper, real, geometric reality. Ensure the 720-degree symmetry of the electron is explained not as a quantum mystery, but as the natural topological property of the `Spin(3)` group's double cover over rotations, a concept now made visible.

Finally, when approaching Gauge Theory and General Relativity, adopt a tone of confident exploration. Frame these topics as the natural continuation of the book's central pattern: local symmetry is simply local geometric rotation. Present Gauge Theory Gravity not as dogma, but as a compelling demonstration of GA's ultimate potential, showing that even gravity can be understood through the same universal versor mechanism. Throughout the chapter, constantly weave back to the core tools—the geometric product, the sandwich product, and the power of subalgebras—to reinforce the astonishing unity of the framework, from computer graphics to cosmology.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+11.md` for **Cycle 11** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
