Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Appendix C, "Multiplication and Reference Tables." This appendix serves as the computational bedrock for the entire manuscript. It is not a section for narrative, but for absolute, unassailable factual correctness and clarity. It is the ground truth from which all other claims can be derived. Your responsibility is to ensure it is perfect.

The core of this task is meticulous verification. You must treat every table not as a static piece of text, but as a set of claims to be re-derived and confirmed. The product `e₂e₁` in the 3D tables must be consistent with the reverse operation on `e₁e₂`. The bivector commutators in Table C.12 must arise directly from the geometric products defined earlier. The quaternion relations in Table C.13 must be a direct consequence of the bivector products in Table C.3. Perform this deep, relational consistency check across all tables.

Beyond correctness, focus on pedagogical clarity for the practitioner. For each multiplication table, ensure there is a brief, preceding sentence that provides context and instructs the user on how to read it, transforming it from a dense block of data into an accessible tool. For the more abstract tables, like those for duality and commutators, ensure the framing connects these raw numbers to the structures they represent—the Hodge dual and the Lie algebra of rotations. This appendix should not only provide answers but also reinforce the theoretical elegance of the framework.

Finally, scrutinize the "Binary Blade Indexing Scheme." This is the key to any efficient software implementation. Confirm that the mapping is clear, the examples are correct, and the relationship between the bitwise operations and the algebraic rules is transparent. This section must empower the programmer to translate the book's theory into fast, correct code. Make this appendix a testament to the fact that in Geometric Algebra, every calculation is a direct expression of a deeper geometric structure.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+AC.md` for **Cycle AC** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
