Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Chapter Nine, "Visual Computing Unified: Graphics and Vision as One." This chapter's mission is to heal the historical schism between computer graphics and computer vision, presenting them not as separate disciplines but as inverse operations within a single, unified geometric framework. Ensure this powerful theme resonates from the opening paragraph to the final conclusion. Frame the narrative around the core insight that graphics is an act of construction, akin to the outer product, while vision is an act of inference and constraint satisfaction, akin to the inner product and the meet.

The geometric camera model is the chapter's centerpiece. Your polish should focus on transforming the projection formula from a string of symbols into a clear, intuitive geometric procedure. Deconstruct the expression `(C ∧ P ∧ n∞) ∨ Σ`. Explain it as a story: we take the camera's center `C` and a world point `P` to define a point pair; we wedge with infinity `n∞` to construct the unique ray passing through them; finally, we find where this ray `meets` the image surface `Σ`. This step-by-step geometric narrative is paramount for reader understanding. Ensure the flexibility of this model is highlighted—its ability to handle planar, spherical, or even non-Euclidean image surfaces with no change to the core logic.

When discussing the unified ray tracer, the architectural simplification is the key signal to amplify. Contrast the single, elegant line of CGA code—`intersection = ray ∨ Object`—with the complex, branching switch statement required in a traditional engine to handle different primitive types. This is the tangible proof of the framework's power. For the advanced topics of illumination and polarization, frame them as a look into a more physically-impactful future. The bivector nature of light is not just a mathematical curiosity; it is the gateway to rendering effects like polarization that are clumsy or impossible in a purely vector-based world.

The second half of the chapter pivots to vision. The crucial argument here is the superiority of performing optimizations, like bundle adjustment, directly on the motor manifold. Refine this section to emphasize the clean, unconstrained nature of optimizing in the bivector Lie algebra. Contrast this with the constant need to enforce constraints in traditional approaches—the unit-norm of quaternions or the orthogonality of rotation matrices. The motor is not just another parameterization; it is the *correct* singularity-free space for rigid motions. Ensure the algorithms for SfM and SLAM feel like a natural culmination of all the book's concepts: geometric features, motor-based poses, and bivector-based optimization, all working in seamless harmony.

Polish the chapter's tables, particularly the "Camera Model Unification" and "Bundle Adjustment Comparison," to ensure every entry is a concise, powerful argument for the CGA approach. This chapter should leave the reader with the undeniable conviction that graphics and vision are two dialects of the same geometric language, and that language is Geometric Algebra.
