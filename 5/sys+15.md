Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Chapter Fifteen, "The Practitioner's Handbook: From Theory to Production Code." This chapter serves as the crucial bridge connecting the beautiful theory of the preceding sections to the unforgiving reality of finite-precision computation. Its purpose is not merely to list algorithms, but to instill in the practitioner a deep sense of confidence that Geometric Algebra is a robust, reliable, and performant foundation for real-world software. Every word, every algorithm, and every explanation must serve this goal.

Begin by framing the chapter's core challenge: how to preserve the perfect, continuous world of geometric algebra within the discrete, error-prone world of the digital computer. Emphasize that the solutions presented are not ad-hoc patches, but principled techniques derived from the algebra's own structure.

When discussing multivector representation, guide the reader through the decision-making process. Present the dense, sparse, and grade-stratified approaches not just as options, but as a logical progression of thought that culminates in the grade-stratified design as the superior choice for its alignment of memory layout with mathematical structure. This is a lesson in data-oriented design, not just a choice of container.

For the implementation of the geometric product, ensure the explanation of the binary blade encoding is exceptionally clear. This is the engine at the heart of the library; the reader must understand how the abstract product becomes a sequence of efficient, low-level bitwise operations.

The sections on numerical challenges are the most critical for building trust. Frame the entire discussion around the universal pattern of robust geometric programming: **First, detect the degeneracy; second, handle it gracefully.** Each algorithm, from robust line intersection to the meet operation, must be an exemplar of this philosophy. Show how the algebra itself provides the tools for detection—an inner product approaching zero, a wedge product vanishing. Show how this is superior to traditional methods that often fail silently or with a catastrophic division by zero. Address the practitioner's deepest fears about numerical instability head-on and demonstrate that GA provides a diagnostic toolkit, not just a calculator.

In discussing the maintenance of versor constraints, explain *why* this is necessary—that floating-point arithmetic is not a perfect field and will always introduce drift. Present the normalization and reconstruction algorithms as projections, elegant operations that guide a slightly strayed multivector back to the pure, correct manifold of transformations.

Finally, ensure every algorithm presented with utmost clarity. The pseudocode must be clean, and its comments must explain the *geometric reasoning* behind the code, not merely restate the operation. The practitioner should leave this chapter not just with a set of recipes, but with a reinvigorated understanding of how to think, code, and build robustly in the language of Geometric Algebra.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+15.md` for **Cycle 15** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
