Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Chapter Seven, "The Algebra of Incidence: Meet, Join, and Duality." This chapter is the keystone of the book's theoretical arch. Chapters 1 through 6 build the components—objects and transformations—while Chapter 7 teaches the reader how to assemble them into meaningful geometric statements. It is where representation becomes relation. Your primary focus must be on transforming its abstract power into concrete, unshakeable intuition.

This chapter's central theme must be the formal introduction and exploration of the **Duality Principle**. This principle, which governs the relationship between an object's construction (Outer Product Null Space, or OPNS) and its constraints (Inner Product Null Space, or IPNS), must be presented as a cornerstone of geometric reasoning. You will formally introduce the term and weave it throughout the entire chapter narrative.

To make this principle tangible, you must build upon a powerful analogy. An OPNS representation is like building a chair by listing every atom it contains—a constructive, bottom-up approach. An IPNS representation is describing that same chair by the constraints it satisfies—it touches the floor, it's below the ceiling, it's not inside the wall. It is a top-down, constraint-based view. The dual operator, `*`, is the all-important translator that lets us switch between these two equally valid ways of seeing. Ensure this analogy is present and consistently referenced.

The formula for the `meet` operation, `$A \vee B = (A^* \wedge B^*)^*$` must be demystified by presenting it as a dynamic, four-step narrative of applying the Duality Principle. First, we take our two objects, A and B. Second, we apply the dual to each, shifting our perspective from the objects themselves (their atoms) to the set of all constraints that define them (the rules they obey). Third, we use the familiar outer product to combine these two sets of constraints into a single, unified list. Finally, we apply the dual again to translate this unified list of constraints back into the one geometric object that satisfies them all. It is a process of `reframe -> combine -> reframe`. Make the text walk the reader through this logical journey.

Elevate the "Lattice Structure" section beyond a simple definition. Show the reader that the algebra's properties, like the absorption law `A ∨ (A ∧ B) = A`, are not just abstract mathematics; they are a framework for automated geometric reasoning. Translate the symbols into plain English geometric truths: "The intersection of an object `A` with the larger object spanned by `A` and another object `B` is, of course, simply `A` itself." Show that the algebra inherently understands containment and hierarchy.

Finally, this chapter must serve as the direct and explicit setup for the payoff in Part Three. The reader should finish this chapter understanding that the `meet` operation, powered by the Duality Principle, is the single weapon that will be used to vanquish the entire "Fragmentation Matrix" from Chapter 1. The promise of unification, made in the beginning, is given its primary tool right here. Ensure that connection is explicit and powerful, setting the stage for the applications to come.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+07.md` for **Cycle 7** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
