Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Chapter Five, "Citizenship on the Null Cone: The Conformal Representation." This chapter is the heart of the entire manuscript. It is here that we make good on the promise of the conformal model, introducing the core representational machinery that underpins all subsequent applications. The clarity and intuitive power of this chapter will determine the reader's ultimate success. Every sentence must serve the goal of making this geometric leap of intuition feel not just understandable, but inevitable and right.

Your primary focus must be on the introduction and explanation of the conformal embedding formula. Do not simply present it as a given. Frame its introduction as a moment of revelation. The formula itself, `$P = \mathbf{p} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0$`, is the key that unlocks the kingdom. Ensure that its components are not just mathematically defined, but geometrically motivated. The term `n₀` anchors our space at the origin; the term `n∞` provides the point at infinity needed for translations and lines; the crucial `(1/2)p²` term is the precise "lift" required to transform the nonlinear Euclidean distance formula into a simple, linear inner product.

The concept of the null cone must be elevated from a mathematical curiosity to the central arena of our new geometry. Emphasize that every point in Euclidean space finds its new home on the surface of this cone. The condition `$P^2 = 0$` should be presented as the fundamental law of this new universe—the very definition of a point. Consequently, the squared magnitude of any object (`$S^2` for a sphere, `$π^2` for a plane) becomes its most essential classifier, defining its nature and reality.

The tables in this chapter, especially the "Conformal Dictionary" and the "Inner Product Encyclopedia," are not mere references; they are arguments. Polish them to make the unification stark and clear. When presenting the representations of points, spheres, and planes, drive home the radical simplification: these once-disparate geometric "types" are now all revealed to be the same kind of algebraic object—a grade-1 vector. The "Inner Product Encyclopedia" must be framed as a catalog of miracles. A single, consistent operation—the inner product—is shown to replace a dozen unique and unrelated formulas from traditional geometry. Ensure each row in that table feels like a victory for unification.

Throughout the chapter, maintain a delicate balance between algebraic rigor and geometric intuition. Every equation should be paired with a picture in the mind's eye. Every new object representation should immediately be used to answer a simple geometric question. The reader must feel that they are not just learning a new set of rules, but are being given a new, more powerful way to see.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+05.md` for **Cycle 5** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
