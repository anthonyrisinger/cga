Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Appendix B, "The Complete Formula Reference." This is not a simple validation of equations. Your objective is to transform this appendix from a static list of formulas into a dynamic and insightful Rosetta Stone that connects the book's algebraic formalism to its deep geometric meaning. For a practitioner, this will be one of the most frequently visited sections; it must be of utmost of clarity and utility.

The core principle for this pass is to infuse every formula with its geometric soul. For each equation, you must provide a concise, powerful, and memorable "Geometric Interpretation" or "Intuition" note. This note should distill the essence of the formula into a simple, tangible idea. For instance, the point embedding formula should be accompanied by the insight that it "lifts a Euclidean point onto a 5D paraboloid that lies on the null cone." The rotor construction should be explained as "a rotation being the exponential of the bivector representing its plane." Similarly, the motor interpolation formula must be understood as "finding the constant screw velocity that connects two poses and applying a fraction of that motion." This practice must be applied universally throughout the appendix.

Beyond adding intuition, you are responsible for ensuring perfect consistency. Every formula presented here must be identical in form and notation to its appearance in the main body of the text. Cross-reference every equation with its original introduction to guarantee there are no discrepancies.

Finally, consider the pedagogical flow of the appendix itself. Are the formulas organized in the most logical way? Does the reader's journey flow naturally from fundamental embeddings and constructions to more complex operations like intersections and transformations? Reorder sections if a more intuitive path can be forged. The goal is to create a reference that not only provides answers but actively teaches and reinforces the geometric way of thinking every time it is consulted.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+AB.md` for **Cycle AB** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
