Your task is to perform a single cycle of work in accordance with the fifth and final polish pass on Appendix D, "The Practitioner's Toolkit: Robust Implementations." This appendix serves as the bridge between the book's abstract theory and the concrete reality of implementation. It is the engine room. Your goal is to ensure it functions not just as a repository of code, but as an exemplary work unto itself in the art of writing robust, efficient, and geometrically-aware software.

Review every algorithm, from the fundamental `SPARSE_GEOMETRIC_PRODUCT` to the complex `FIT_SPHERE_ROBUST`. The pseudocode itself must be a medium of instruction. Scrutinize the comments within each algorithm. They must transcend mere procedural description. A comment should not simply state *what* a line of code does, but *why* it does it from a geometric standpoint. For instance, when checking for a near-zero magnitude in the `ROBUST_MEET` operation, the comment must explain that this isn't just a numerical check; it's the algebraic signal for a geometric degeneracy like parallelism or containment. Every line of code should be an opportunity to reinforce the book's core geometric lessons.

Ensure that the algorithms are presented as "recipes," as the title implies. Each one should embody a general pattern for solving a class of problems. The `ROBUST_MEET` algorithm is the template for all safe intersection testing. The `MOTOR_SLERP` is the template for all smooth manifold interpolations. The structure and naming within the pseudocode should reflect this templated nature, making the patterns easy to recognize and adapt.

The internal consistency of this appendix is non-negotiable. Verify that every algorithm is a perfect and robust implementation of the corresponding theoretical formulas presented in Appendix B and the concepts developed in the main chapters. When the reader compares the `CIRCUMSPHERE_4_POINTS` recipe to the theoretical `(P₁ ∧ P₂ ∧ P₃ ∧ P₄)^*` formula, the connection must be direct and obvious.

Finally, consider the programmer who will turn this appendix into a working library. The logic must be unambiguous, the flow intuitive, and the handling of edge cases and numerical precision issues must be both explicit and instructive. This appendix is the ultimate practical payoff for the reader's entire journey. Its success is measured by the confidence and competence it instills in the practitioner. Forge it into a flawless and deeply educational guide to the art of geometric computation.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+AD.md` for **Cycle AD** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all 11th-hour polish flowed in.
