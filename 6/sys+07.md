This is Cycle SEVEN (7); write a comprehensive revision of the section entitled "Chapter 7: The Algebra of Incidence: Meet, Join, and Duality" addressing these requirements:

Transform this chapter to present meet, join, and duality as powerful tools for geometric computation while acknowledging their implementation complexities. Begin by establishing the genuine value: these operations provide a unified algebraic framework for geometric relationships that traditionally require numerous specialized algorithms. However, immediately acknowledge that "unified" doesn't mean "simple" - the meet operation, while conceptually elegant, involves multiple steps (dual, wedge, dual) that can accumulate numerical errors and computational cost.

Reframe the "Two Ways of Seeing" section to emphasize practical utility. The chair analogy works well but should explicitly state when each representation is computationally advantageous. OPNS excels when you're building objects from known constituents (three points define a circle). IPNS excels when testing membership or constraints (is this point on the sphere?). Make clear that choosing the right representation for each task is key to efficient implementation.

When introducing the Duality Principle, maintain its mathematical importance while adding practical context. The dual operation requires multiplication by the pseudoscalar inverse, which in 5D conformal space involves significant computation. Note that while duality provides theoretical unity, implementations often cache both representations for frequently-used objects to avoid repeated conversions.

For the meet operation section, preserve the four-act story but add computational reality. After presenting the elegant formula $A \vee B = (A^* \wedge B^*)^*$, immediately note that this involves three expensive operations, each potentially introducing numerical error. The traditional specialized algorithms it replaces may be less elegant but can be more numerically stable and faster for specific cases. Frame meet as invaluable when you need general geometric intersection capability, but acknowledge that specialized methods may still be optimal for performance-critical paths handling known object types.

Present the tables showing meet/join results but add a column for "Computational Considerations" noting where numerical issues arise (nearly parallel planes, nearly tangent spheres, skew lines in 3D). Be explicit that while the meet operation handles these cases algebraically, detecting and interpreting near-degenerate configurations requires careful numerical analysis.

In the implementation blueprints, add explicit error handling and numerical tolerance management. Show how to detect when results are numerically unreliable. Include comments about computational complexity - for instance, the meet of two general multivectors can involve operations on up to 32 components in 5D CGA.

Add a new section on "Choosing Between Algebraic and Traditional Methods" that honestly compares approaches. For example: finding line-line intersection in 3D. The GA method (meet operation) handles all cases uniformly but requires ~100 floating-point operations. The traditional method needs separate handling for parallel/skew/intersecting cases but uses ~20 operations for the common case. Present this as an engineering tradeoff, not a failing of either approach.

Throughout, maintain enthusiasm for the conceptual clarity GA provides while being honest about implementation challenges. The lattice structure section should emphasize that while theoretically beautiful, actually using it for automated reasoning requires careful attention to numerical tolerances and can be computationally expensive for large geometric configurations.

For the exercises, keep the conceptual and mathematical ones as-is, but modify the implementation challenges to include explicit requirements for performance measurement and comparison with traditional methods. Add an exercise comparing meet operation performance and accuracy against specialized intersection routines.

Replace language suggesting GA "transforms" or "replaces" traditional computational geometry with framing that positions it as a powerful additional tool. The conclusion should acknowledge that mastering these operations requires significant investment but provides valuable capabilities for problems involving complex geometric relationships, mixed object types, or when implementation simplicity is worth modest performance costs.

Mathematical notation should use GFM-compatible LaTeX syntax (like $A \wedge B$ not Unicode âˆ§). Keep the technical accuracy while moderating claims and adding practical engineering context throughout.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+07.md` for **Cycle 7** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all last-minute polish flowed in (REMEMBER: LaTeX LaTeX LaTeX! RETAIN ALL TABLES! Python Python Python even if force rewrite!).
