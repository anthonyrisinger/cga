This is Cycle ZERO (0); write a comprehensive revision of the section entitled "Preface and Notation at a Glance" that transforms the evangelical advocacy into **compelling** professional guidance while preserving mathematical rigor and comprehensive scope.

Replace the opening "fragmentation crisis" narrative with acknowledgment that specialized tools exist for good reasons—matrix algebras efficiently handle rotations, quaternions elegantly represent orientations, vector calculus naturally describes fields. Frame the genuine challenge as coordination overhead and **conceptual friction** when problems require multiple representations, not that existing tools are fundamentally broken. Present geometric algebra as revealing the **surprisingly elegant** algebraic structure connecting these tools, offering **both architectural simplification and conceptual clarity** when problems naturally span multiple geometric domains or require coordinate-free formulations.

Rewrite the "Shape of One is Two" explanation to focus on the concrete mathematical insight: the geometric product naturally decomposes into symmetric (inner) and antisymmetric (outer) parts, unifying scalar and bivector information in one operation. Remove mystical overtones **while retaining the sense of mathematical elegance.**

Replace vague claims about "transforming computation" with specific examples: the sandwich product unifies transformation operators, the meet operation provides consistent intersection algorithms across different geometric primitives, conformal representation enables translation to be multiplicative. Add explicit acknowledgment that these benefits come with tradeoffs: increased memory usage (e.g., 5 floats per 3D point versus 3), computational overhead for full multivector operations, and a significant learning investment comparable to first encountering quaternions or tensors.

Restructure the five-part journey description to emphasize practical discovery: Part I explores recurring computational patterns across domains and how reflection naturally leads to the geometric product. Part II presents the conformal model as one useful extension among several geometric algebras, not the ultimate geometry. Part III demonstrates applications with honest performance comparisons—where GA excels (unified transformation chains, coordinate-free algorithms) and where specialized methods remain superior (highly optimized single-purpose operations). Part IV explores emerging applications without hyperbole. Part V provides implementation guidance while acknowledging current ecosystem limitations compared to established tools.

Add a new section after the journey overview explicitly addressing "When to Use Geometric Algebra": problems involving mixed geometric primitives, coordinate-free formulations, unified transformation handling, educational contexts where conceptual clarity matters. Equally important, "When to Consider Alternatives": performance-critical inner loops with existing optimized solutions, teams without GA expertise, purely 2D problems where complex numbers suffice.

Throughout the preface, replace language suggesting GA "dissolves complexity" or makes things "simple" with accurate descriptions: GA provides conceptual unification, reduces special-case handling, and enables elegant formulations. Acknowledge that implementation complexity **shifts from managing representational boilerplate to understanding geometric operations**, rather than disappearing entirely.

For Notation at a Glance, add introductory paragraph: "This reference section comprehensively catalogs the notation used throughout the book. **We recommend treating this as a dictionary to consult as you read, rather than a list to memorize upfront.** The notation builds naturally through the chapters, with each symbol introduced when its geometric meaning becomes clear."

Maintain all technical content in tables exactly as presented. Ensure all mathematical notation uses GFM-compatible LaTeX with no Unicode symbols in math mode. Preserve the comprehensive scope while framing it as professional reference material rather than doctrinal scripture.

Write with clear, engaging prose using contractions where natural. Maintain an authoritative tone that respects both GA's genuine contributions and readers' existing expertise. Present GA as a valuable addition to the geometric computation toolkit, not a replacement for all existing methods.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+00.md` for **Cycle 0** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all last-minute polish flowed in (REMEMBER: LaTeX LaTeX LaTeX! RETAIN ALL TABLES! Python Python Python even if force rewrite!).
