### Chapter 5: Citizenship on the Null Cone: The Conformal Representation

The moment has arrived to make concrete what we've been building toward. We have our 5-dimensional conformal space with its carefully chosen metric. Now we must discover how to embed our familiar 3D objects into this space in a way that preserves their geometric relationships while linearizing all transformations.

The embedding we're about to explore isn't arbitrary. It emerges from the requirement that Euclidean distances and angles must be preserved while making translations into multiplicative operations. The result will seem almost magical: a simple formula that opens up an entire universe of computational possibilities.

#### The Conformal Embedding

Let's start with the fundamental question: how does a 3D Euclidean point $\mathbf{p} = x\mathbf{e}_1 + y\mathbf{e}_2 + z\mathbf{e}_3$ become a 5D conformal point? The embedding formula is:

$$P = \mathbf{p} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0$$

At first glance, this seems arbitrary. Why this particular combination? Why the factor of $\frac{1}{2}$? Why include both $\mathbf{n}_0$ and $\mathbf{n}_\infty$? The answer lies in the remarkable properties this embedding creates.

#### Null Cone Membership

The defining property of conformal points is that they're null vectors—they have zero norm. Let's verify this:

$$P^2 = \left(\mathbf{p} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0\right)^2$$

Expanding using the properties $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{n}_0 = 0$, $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{n}_\infty = 0$, $\mathbf{n}_0^2 = 0$, $\mathbf{n}_\infty^2 = 0$, and $\mathbf{n}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n}_\infty = -1$:

$$P^2 = \mathbf{p}^2 + 2\mathbf{p} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty\right) + 2\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{n}_0 + 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}_0 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\right)^2\mathbf{n}_\infty^2 + \mathbf{n}_0^2$$

$$P^2 = \mathbf{p}^2 + 0 + 0 + \mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty \cdot \mathbf{n}_0 + 0 + 0$$

$$P^2 = \mathbf{p}^2 + \mathbf{p}^2(-1) = 0$$

Perfect! Every Euclidean point maps to a null vector. But why is this important? Because null vectors in our 5D space with signature (4,1,0) form a cone—analogous to the light cone in special relativity. All Euclidean points live on this null cone, giving them a unified geometric home.

#### Distance Encoding

The true magic appears when we compute the inner product of two conformal points:

$$P_1 \cdot P_2 = \left(\mathbf{p}_1 + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0\right) \cdot \left(\mathbf{p}_2 + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_2^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0\right)$$

Working through the algebra:

$$P_1 \cdot P_2 = \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_2 + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1^2(\mathbf{n}_\infty \cdot \mathbf{n}_0) + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_2^2(\mathbf{n}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n}_\infty) + (\mathbf{n}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n}_0)$$

$$P_1 \cdot P_2 = \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_2 - \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1^2 - \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_2^2$$

$$P_1 \cdot P_2 = -\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{p}_1^2 - 2\mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_2 + \mathbf{p}_2^2) = -\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{p}_2\|^2$$

The inner product encodes the squared Euclidean distance! This is why the conformal embedding works: it transforms the nonlinear distance formula into a simple inner product.

#### The Complete Representation Catalog

Points are just the beginning. The conformal model represents all geometric objects as elements of our 5D geometric algebra:

**Table 17: The Conformal Dictionary**

| Object | Euclidean Description | Conformal Representation | Grade | Key Property |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------|--------------|
| Point | Position $\mathbf{p}$ | $P = \mathbf{p} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0$ | 1 | $P^2 = 0$ |
| Sphere | Center $\mathbf{c}$, radius $r$ | $S = \mathbf{c} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{c}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0 - \frac{1}{2}r^2\mathbf{n}_\infty$ | 1 | $S^2 = r^2$ |
| Plane | Normal $\mathbf{n}$, distance $d$ | $\pi = \mathbf{n} + d\mathbf{n}_\infty$ | 1 | $\pi^2 = 1$ (unit normal) |
| Line | Through points $P_1$, $P_2$ | $L = P_1 \wedge P_2 \wedge \mathbf{n}_\infty$ | 2 | $L^2 \leq 0$ |
| Circle | Through points $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ | $C = P_1 \wedge P_2 \wedge P_3$ | 2 | $C^2 > 0$ |
| Point pair | Points $P_1$, $P_2$ | $PP = P_1 \wedge P_2$ | 2 | $PP^2 = \frac{1}{2}d^2 > 0$ |
| Flat point | Point at infinity | Direction $\mathbf{d}$: $\mathbf{d} + \mathbf{n}_\infty$ | 1 | Represents direction |

Notice something remarkable: spheres and planes are both grade-1 objects (vectors), just like points! This unification has deep computational implications.

#### Understanding the Null Cone Structure

The null cone isn't just a mathematical abstraction—it has deep geometric meaning:

**Table 18: Null Cone Properties**

| Property | Mathematical Form | Geometric Interpretation | Physical Analogy |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Null condition | $X^2 = 0$ | All Euclidean points | Light cone in relativity |
| Inside cone | $X^2 < 0$ | Impossible for real points | Timelike separation |
| Outside cone | $X^2 > 0$ | Spheres with real radius | Spacelike separation |
| Cone equation | $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_+^2 - x_-^2 = 0$ | 4D surface in 5D | Minkowski structure |
| Stereographic | Project from $-\mathbf{n}_0$ through cone to $\mathbf{n}_0 = -1$ plane | Maps sphere to plane | Conformal map |
| Scaling freedom | $\lambda P$ represents same point | Homogeneous coordinates | Projective structure |

The null cone structure explains why the conformal model works: it's the unique surface where Euclidean geometry can be linearized.

#### How the Inner Product Encodes Everything

The inner product in conformal space encodes all geometric relationships:

**Table 19: Inner Product Encyclopedia**

| $A \cdot B$ | Result | Geometric Meaning | Example |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| $P_1 \cdot P_2$ | $-\frac{1}{2}d^2$ | Half negative squared distance | Points separated by $d$ |
| $P \cdot S$ | $\frac{1}{2}(d^2 - r^2)$ | Power of point w.r.t. sphere | $< 0$ inside, $> 0$ outside |
| $P \cdot \pi$ | $d$ | Signed distance to plane | Positive on normal side |
| $P \cdot L$ | 0 | Point lies on line | Incidence condition |
| $S_1 \cdot S_2$ | $\frac{1}{2}(d^2 - r_1^2 - r_2^2)$ | Sphere arrangement | $< 0$ intersecting |
| $\pi_1 \cdot \pi_2$ | $\cos\theta$ | Cosine of angle | Between unit normals |
| $L_1 \cdot L_2$ | Complex | Line configuration | Encodes angle and distance |

Every geometric relationship reduces to an inner product computation—no special cases, no separate formulas.

#### Computational Implications

The conformal representation dramatically simplifies geometric computation:

**Table 20: Dimension and Grade Analysis**

| Object Type | Traditional Storage | Conformal Storage | Grade | Operations Simplified |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|---------------------|
| Point | 3 floats | 5 floats (sparse: 4) | 1 | All transformations |
| Line | 6 floats (Plücker) | 10 floats (sparse: 6) | 2 | Meet/join natural |
| Plane | 4 floats | 5 floats (sparse: 4) | 1 | Same as sphere! |
| Circle | 7 floats (center + radius + normal) | 10 floats (sparse: 8) | 2 | Same as line! |
| Sphere | 4 floats | 5 floats (sparse: 4) | 1 | Same as plane! |
| Transformation | 16 floats (4×4 matrix) | 8 floats (versor) | Even | Universal sandwich |

The "sparse" counts show that many coefficients are often zero, enabling optimized storage. More importantly, operations that require different algorithms traditionally now use the same algebraic operations.

#### Building Geometric Objects

Let's see how to construct common objects in the conformal model:

**Sphere Construction**: A sphere with center at $(1, 2, 3)$ and radius $5$:
```
Center point: c = e₁ + 2e₂ + 3e₃
Conformal center: C = c + ½(1² + 2² + 3²)n∞ + n₀ = c + 7n∞ + n₀
Sphere: S = C - ½(5²)n∞ = c + 7n∞ + n₀ - 12.5n∞ = c - 5.5n∞ + n₀
Verify: S² = 25 ✓
```

**Plane Construction**: A plane with unit normal $(0, 0, 1)$ at distance $2$ from origin:
```
Normal: n = e₃
Plane: π = n + 2n∞
Verify: π² = 1 ✓
```

**Line Construction**: A line through points $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$:
```
P₁ = e₁ + ½n∞ + n₀
P₂ = e₂ + ½n∞ + n₀
Line: L = P₁ ∧ P₂ ∧ n∞
```

The $\mathbf{n}_\infty$ in the line construction is crucial—it forces the object to be straight (infinite radius) rather than curved.

#### The Deep Structure

Why does this particular embedding work so beautifully? The answer lies in the relationship between the null cone and conformal transformations. In physics, the light cone preserves causal structure. In conformal geometry, the null cone preserves angle structure. This isn't just an analogy—it's the same mathematics applied to different contexts.

The embedding formula $P = \mathbf{p} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0$ can be understood as:
- $\mathbf{p}$: The Euclidean position
- $\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty$: A "height" in the $\mathbf{n}_\infty$ direction proportional to distance from origin
- $\mathbf{n}_0$: A unit "bias" ensuring proper normalization

This creates a paraboloid in 5D space, intersected with the null cone constraint. The result is a 3D surface that perfectly encodes Euclidean geometry.

#### Practical Considerations

When implementing the conformal model, several practical issues arise:

1. **Normalization**: Conformal points can be scaled by any non-zero factor. Sometimes we normalize so that $P \cdot \mathbf{n}_\infty = -1$.

2. **Numerical Precision**: The $\mathbf{p}^2$ term can grow large for distant points. Working in a bounded domain or using periodic renormalization helps.

3. **Sparse Representation**: Many coefficients are zero. The point $P = \mathbf{p} + \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}^2\mathbf{n}_\infty + \mathbf{n}_0$ has only 4 non-zero components out of 5.

4. **Extraction**: To extract the Euclidean position from a conformal point:
   $$\mathbf{p} = \frac{P - (P \cdot \mathbf{n}_\infty)\mathbf{n}_0}{-P \cdot \mathbf{n}_\infty}$$

#### The Unification Achieved

We've successfully embedded Euclidean geometry into conformal space. Points, lines, planes, circles, and spheres all become elements of our 5D geometric algebra. Their relationships are encoded in inner products. But we haven't yet seen the true payoff: how transformations work in this space.

*Next, we'll discover how every Euclidean transformation—rotation, translation, scaling, and more—becomes a simple sandwich product with a versor.*
