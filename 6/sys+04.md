This is Cycle FOUR (4); write a comprehensive revision of the section entitled "Chapter 4: Beyond Euclidean Boundaries: The Search for a Universal Space" (modifying to "Chapter 4: The Conformal Model: Extending Our Geometric Framework" to avoid claiming universality and better reflect the chapter's actual scope).

Transform this chapter to present the conformal model as a valuable extension of Euclidean geometry that solves specific computational challenges, particularly the unification of rotations and translations under a single algebraic pattern. Begin with the concrete problem: in graphics pipelines and robotics systems, constantly switching between multiplicative transformations (rotations via quaternions or matrices) and additive transformations (translations via vector addition) creates complexity and prevents elegant composition.

Frame the search for a solution not as finding "the universal space" but as exploring whether an extended geometric framework could make translations multiplicative like rotations. Present Klein's Erlangen Program as historical context showing how different geometries serve different purposes, not as justification for seeking one geometry to rule them all.

When discussing the projective attempt, acknowledge its genuine utility in computer graphics (homogeneous coordinates are widely used) while explaining why it doesn't preserve the metric properties needed for physics and engineering applications. The stereographic projection section should emphasize that conformal geometry preserves angles but not distances—a specific tradeoff, not magical unification.

For the embedding dimension analysis, maintain the systematic approach but clarify that we're seeking the minimal space where conformal transformations become orthogonal transformations, not discovering some mystical requirement. Table 13 should note that each geometry type excels in its domain—projective for vision, Euclidean for mechanics, conformal for certain unification benefits.

In Table 14, replace "Nothing!" in the "What's Lost" column with "Direct distance representation," acknowledging that while conformal geometry preserves angles and encodes distances in inner products, it requires more complex extraction of Euclidean measurements. Be explicit that the 5D representation trades directness for algebraic unity.

Table 16 should include not just storage overhead but computational costs. Add rows for "Multiplication cost" and "Extraction cost" showing that conformal operations require more floating-point operations than their specialized counterparts. Note that the benefit is architectural simplification and elimination of special cases, not raw performance.

Throughout, emphasize that conformal geometric algebra provides a consistent computational framework particularly valuable when:

- Mixing different transformation types frequently
- Implementing general geometric algorithms
- Prioritizing code clarity over raw performance
- Working with problems naturally expressed in conformal terms

Add a section explicitly discussing when NOT to use conformal geometry:

- Performance-critical inner loops where specialized methods are faster
- Systems with severe memory constraints
- Teams unfamiliar with GA where training time is prohibitive
- Problems that stay purely within one transformation type

The path forward should present learning the conformal embedding as understanding a useful mathematical tool, not ascending to geometric enlightenment. End by noting that the next chapter will detail how this embedding works in practice, with concrete algorithms for converting between representations.

Maintain all mathematical content, ensuring LaTeX compatibility with GitHub-flavored Markdown (use `$\Vert$` for norms, `$\cdot$` for dot products, avoid Unicode in math mode). Write with clarity and precision, using contractions where they improve readability. Present conformal geometry as a powerful option in the practitioner's toolkit, not the ultimate answer to all geometric computation.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+04.md` for **Cycle 4** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all last-minute polish flowed in (REMEMBER: LaTeX LaTeX LaTeX! RETAIN ALL TABLES! Python Python Python even if force rewrite!).
