This is Cycle EIGHT (8); write a comprehensive revision of the section entitled "Computational Geometry Transformed: Algorithms Reimagined Through GA" following these requirements:

Transform the opening from describing geometric kernels as "sprawling codebases" plagued by special cases to acknowledging that specialized algorithms exist for good reasons—they're often highly optimized for specific tasks. Present the line-cylinder intersection example not as a "nightmare" but as a complex problem that traditional methods handle through case analysis for valid geometric reasons. Frame the chapter's question as: "Can geometric algebra offer a unified approach that **reduces architectural complexity and improves maintainability**, while maintaining acceptable performance?"

Replace claims of "systematic outperformance" with honest analysis. When presenting the universal intersection algorithm, acknowledge upfront that while $A \cap B = (A^* \wedge B^*)^*$ is conceptually elegant, computing duals and wedge products in 5D space carries computational overhead. **Present a concrete comparison:** The traditional line-plane intersection using parametric equations typically requires ~10 floating-point operations, while the CGA meet operation involves ~50-100 operations. **Then, state the architectural benefit:** The GA approach uses the same code path for line-plane, line-sphere, and sphere-sphere intersections, drastically reducing the number of algorithms a team must implement, test, and maintain.

For the algorithm complexity comparison table, add a column for memory requirements: traditional 3D line uses 6 floats, CGA line uses 10 floats in a sparse representation. Be explicit that "5-8 lines" of CGA code translates to significantly more computational work, **but also represents a significant reduction in the number of unique logical paths that require debugging and maintenance.**

When discussing numerical stability improvements, acknowledge that while CGA often has better conditioning, this comes at the cost of working in higher dimensions. The improved condition number for near-parallel plane intersection must be weighed against the increased operation count and memory bandwidth requirements.

For the Voronoi diagram section, present the CGA approach as offering elegant mathematical insight—seeing Voronoi cells as power diagrams—while noting that Fortune's algorithm remains asymptotically optimal at O(n log n). The CGA construction is conceptually cleaner, **which can be a major advantage in research or when extending the algorithm to non-Euclidean spaces**, but is computationally heavier per operation.

In the Delaunay triangulation discussion, acknowledge that while the wedge product in-circle test has nice properties, it requires 5D computations compared to the traditional 3D determinant. Modern robust implementations using adaptive precision arithmetic can achieve similar numerical properties, **though the GA formulation provides a more direct geometric interpretation of the predicate.**

For the implementation architecture section, be frank about the challenges: 32-component multivectors require careful memory management, sparse representations add overhead for component tracking, and SIMD optimization is complicated by the non-uniform sparsity patterns. Present these as engineering tradeoffs rather than problems that magically disappear.

Add a new section on "When to Use CGA for Computational Geometry" that honestly recommends:

- Use CGA when algorithmic simplicity and code maintainability outweigh raw performance.
- Use CGA for problems involving many different geometric primitive types where unified treatment saves significant development and testing time.
- Use traditional methods for performance-critical inner loops or when working with specific, well-understood geometric configurations.
- Consider hybrid approaches that use CGA for high-level algorithm structure and system architecture, while optimizing critical paths with traditional methods.

Throughout, maintain technical accuracy while replacing evangelical language with professional assessment. Show CGA as a valuable tool that trades some computational efficiency for conceptual unity and implementation simplicity. Use concrete examples with actual operation counts rather than vague performance claims.

For the exercises, add problems that explore these tradeoffs directly: implement both traditional and CGA versions of algorithms, measure actual performance, and analyze where each approach excels. Include exercises on hybrid implementations that leverage CGA's conceptual clarity while optimizing critical sections.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+08.md` for **Cycle 8** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all last-minute polish flowed in (REMEMBER: LaTeX LaTeX LaTeX! RETAIN ALL TABLES! Python Python Python even if force rewrite!).
