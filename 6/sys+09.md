This is Cycle NINE (9); write a comprehensive revision of the section entitled "Visual Computing Unified: Graphics and Vision as One" that transforms the evangelical tone into balanced technical exposition while preserving the mathematical insights and practical value of geometric algebra for visual computing applications.

Begin by acknowledging that computer graphics and vision have developed separate mathematical toolkits for good reasons—each optimized for specific computational patterns and hardware architectures. Present the genuine fragmentation challenge: maintaining consistent geometric relationships when translating between projection matrices, homogeneous coordinates, quaternion rotations, and optimization manifolds. Frame geometric algebra not as replacing these tools wholesale, but as revealing their underlying geometric unity and enabling more elegant solutions for problems that span both domains.

When introducing camera models through incidence geometry, explain that while the formula $(C \wedge P \wedge \mathbf{n}_\infty) \vee \Sigma$ elegantly expresses projection across different camera types, practical implementations still require careful handling of numerical precision, efficient ray construction, and integration with existing rendering pipelines. The unified formulation excels when working with non-standard cameras or when geometric consistency across multiple views is paramount, but traditional projection matrices remain computationally efficient for fixed pinhole cameras.

For ray tracing, acknowledge that while the meet operation provides conceptual unification, efficient implementations still benefit from specialized intersection routines exploiting primitive-specific properties. The GA approach shines when handling complex geometric queries, mixed primitive types, or when the overhead of representation conversion dominates computation time. Present the architectural simplification as valuable for certain applications—particularly research renderers or systems handling diverse geometric primitives—while noting that production ray tracers may still prefer optimized special-case code.

In discussing illumination models, introduce the bivector representation of light as a natural extension that captures physical phenomena like polarization and area light sources. Emphasize that this enhanced model complements rather than replaces traditional approaches—Lambertian shading remains efficient for diffuse surfaces, while the bivector formulation enables physically accurate rendering when such accuracy justifies the computational cost.

For structure from motion and bundle adjustment, present motor-based optimization as solving real problems: gimbal lock, quaternion normalization, and awkward composition of separate rotation and translation. Acknowledge that converting existing computer vision pipelines requires significant effort, but emphasize specific benefits: numerically stable optimization on the natural manifold, elimination of special cases for planar scenes, and geometrically consistent motion models. Include realistic performance comparisons—motor operations may require more floating-point operations than quaternions, but eliminate normalization steps and constraint handling.

Throughout the chapter, maintain focus on problems where GA's unification provides tangible benefits: differentiable rendering across graphics and vision, geometric deep learning for visual tasks, novel view synthesis with geometric consistency, and visual SLAM with natural motion models. Present implementation blueprints that acknowledge real-world concerns: memory layout for GPU efficiency, sparse storage for multivectors, and integration points with existing libraries.

Replace any universal claims with contextual guidance. Instead of "CGA unifies all visual computing," explain how CGA provides a coherent geometric framework that benefits applications requiring consistent geometric reasoning across rendering and reconstruction. Include practical considerations for adoption: learning curve comparable to mastering homogeneous coordinates and quaternions combined, current lack of optimized libraries for some operations, and the need for team education.

Maintain technical depth while writing in clear, continuous prose. Use Python-style pseudocode for algorithms, avoiding actual language syntax while maintaining readability. Focus on conveying both the geometric insights and engineering tradeoffs, preparing readers to make informed decisions about when and how to apply geometric algebra to visual computing problems.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+09.md` for **Cycle 9** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all last-minute polish flowed in (REMEMBER: LaTeX LaTeX LaTeX! RETAIN ALL TABLES! Python Python Python even if force rewrite!).
