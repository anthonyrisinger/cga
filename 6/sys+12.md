This is Cycle TWELVE (12); write a comprehensive revision of the section entitled "Chapter 12: The Geometric Algebra Landscape: A Multiverse of Geometries" following these requirements:

Transform the opening to present a concrete computational challenge without immediately declaring CGA's limitations. Begin with the gravitational lensing problem as a genuine puzzle: tracking light paths through curved spacetime where traditional Euclidean tools naturally struggle. Present this not as CGA "reaching its limits" but as discovering that different geometric contexts benefit from different algebraic tools—just as we use different data structures for different algorithmic needs.

Replace the evangelical "multiverse of geometries" framing with practical reality: GA provides a systematic approach to constructing algebras matched to specific geometric domains. Acknowledge that this flexibility comes with complexity—choosing the right algebra requires understanding both your problem domain and the algebraic options available.

For each geometric algebra presented (Projective, Spacetime, Quadric), provide balanced coverage that includes: concrete problems it solves well, specific advantages over traditional methods, computational overhead and complexity costs, and situations where simpler approaches remain preferable. For example, when discussing PGA for computer vision, acknowledge that homogeneous coordinates work fine for many applications—PGA's advantage emerges when you need extensive geometric operations on projective elements.

Add explicit "When to Use" guidance for each algebra type. For Spacetime Algebra, note that while unifying electromagnetism is conceptually elegant, Maxwell's equations in vector form remain perfectly serviceable for most engineering applications. The unified form excels when exploring gauge transformations or relativistic quantum mechanics.

Transform Table 43 to include a "Computational Reality" column that honestly states memory requirements and typical operation counts for common tasks. Add a row for "Traditional Alternative" showing what practitioners currently use for each domain.

Rewrite the "Choosing Your Geometric Arena" algorithm to begin with a practical assessment: Can existing tools solve your problem adequately? Only if geometric operations dominate your computation, or if conceptual clarity significantly aids development, should you consider the GA approach. Include checkpoints for team expertise and performance requirements.

Expand the computational strategies section to include concrete benchmarks. Show that while a CGA point requires 5 floats versus 3 for a Euclidean point, operations like "reflect through plane" become single sandwich products rather than matrix multiplications. Present this as a tradeoff, not a universal win.

Add a new section on "Integration with Existing Systems" that acknowledges most practitioners can't rewrite everything in GA. Discuss hybrid approaches: using GA for core geometric algorithms while maintaining traditional interfaces, implementing critical paths in GA while keeping familiar APIs, and gradually introducing GA concepts where they provide clear benefits.

Throughout, maintain technical accuracy while replacing phrases like "reveals territories" and "mathematical structures enable revolutionary algorithms" with concrete statements about what GA can and cannot do. When discussing high-dimensional algebras for string theory, note that these remain largely theoretical tools rather than practical computational frameworks.

Ensure all mathematical notation uses GitHub-flavored Markdown LaTeX syntax exclusively, with no Unicode symbols in mathematical expressions. Include a brief note early in the chapter that readers should reference the notation guide as needed rather than memorizing all symbols upfront.

Write with clear, engaging prose that respects both GA's genuine capabilities and the reader's existing expertise. Use contractions where they improve flow. Acknowledge that different tools excel in different contexts, and GA provides valuable options for specific geometric computation challenges.

This blueprint is complete and final; begin with the deliverable `cga+12.md` for **Cycle 12** rendered top-to-bottom with any and all last-minute polish flowed in (REMEMBER: LaTeX LaTeX LaTeX! RETAIN ALL TABLES! Python Python Python even if force rewrite!).
