### Chapter 9: Visual Computing: Architectural Unity in a Probabilistic World

Computer graphics and computer vision have evolved distinct mathematical toolkits, each refined through decades of research and engineering. Graphics leverages 4×4 matrix pipelines optimized for GPU acceleration, quaternions for smooth rotation interpolation, and specialized shading models tuned for real-time performance. Computer vision employs homogeneous coordinates for projective geometry, Plücker coordinates for spatial reasoning, and manifold optimization techniques for 3D reconstruction. These tools excel within their domains, representing generations of optimization for their specific use cases.

The architectural challenge emerges at the boundaries. Consider visual SLAM, augmented reality, and computational photography systems that must seamlessly integrate both rendering and reconstruction. A visual SLAM system processing sensor data illustrates the challenge: the rendering pipeline uses 4×4 projection matrices optimized for GPU execution, feature matching operates in 2D image coordinates with subpixel precision, triangulation employs either linear least squares or Plücker coordinates depending on the configuration, and bundle adjustment optimizes over $SO(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3$ using specialized parameterizations to avoid singularities. Each subsystem speaks a different mathematical dialect, requiring careful translation at every interface. Moreover, each component must propagate uncertainty through its computations—a challenge that traditional deterministic frameworks handle through auxiliary covariance matrices and Jacobian-based propagation.

These translations introduce both computational overhead and conceptual friction. Converting between quaternion rotations and rotation matrices for different subsystems adds unnecessary operations. Maintaining consistency between the graphics projection matrix and the computer vision camera model requires careful bookkeeping. The impedance mismatch between rendering's forward projection and vision's inverse reconstruction complicates unified pipelines. Each translation point becomes a potential source of numerical error and architectural complexity.

Geometric algebra offers a coherent framework for problems at this intersection—not as a replacement for specialized tools, but as a way to reduce architectural friction when consistent geometric reasoning matters more than raw performance. The geometric product's decomposition preserves complete information about geometric relationships, enabling unified operations across traditionally separate domains. However, this deterministic elegance must confront the probabilistic reality of modern visual computing, where uncertainty propagation and sparse optimization dominate production systems. This chapter examines where GA provides genuine engineering value for visual computing and where traditional methods remain superior.

#### Camera Models: From Matrices to Geometric Incidence

Traditional graphics constructs cameras through carefully assembled projection matrices. A perspective camera combines intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, aspect ratio) with extrinsic pose:

$$ FIXME $$

This matrix formulation excels for fixed pinhole cameras feeding GPU rasterization pipelines. Hardware acceleration, decades of optimization, and deep integration with graphics APIs make it the practical choice for standard rendering tasks. The entire graphics ecosystem—from OpenGL to modern ray tracing APIs—assumes this representation.

Geometric algebra reconceptualizes cameras as geometric entities rather than matrix transformations. A camera consists of:
- An optical center $C$ (a conformal point)
- An image surface $\Sigma$ (plane, sphere, or other manifold)
- Projection as pure geometric incidence

The projection formula becomes:

$$\text{Project}(P) = (C \wedge P \wedge \mathbf{n}_\infty) \vee \Sigma$$

This formula tells a geometric story. The wedge product $C \wedge P$ creates the line between camera center and world point. Including $\mathbf{n}_\infty$ extends this to an infinite ray. The meet with surface $\Sigma$ finds where the ray intersects the image manifold. This single operation handles any camera geometry without special cases.

The strength of this approach lies in its generality—the same formula handles diverse camera models without special cases:

**Table 32: Camera Model Comparison**

| Camera Type | Traditional Implementation | GA Implementation | When GA Excels |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Pinhole | 3×4 matrix multiplication | Point + plane meet | Non-standard image planes |
| Fisheye | Nonlinear distortion polynomials | Point + sphere meet | Unified pipeline needed |
| Cylindrical | Angle-based unwrapping | Point + cylinder meet | Mixed camera systems |
| Orthographic | Parallel projection matrix | Direction + plane meet | Architectural simplicity |
| Cross-slits | Two-line parameterization | Line wedge constraint | Novel view synthesis |
| Light field | 4D ray database | Ray algebra operations | Ray manipulation |

Cross-slits cameras, which generate rays passing through two skew lines in space rather than a single point, exemplify where GA excels. Traditional implementations require complex two-line parameterizations and special ray generation code. In GA, the camera is simply the wedge of two lines, and ray generation follows naturally from the geometric constraint. This elegance extends to even more exotic camera models—non-central catadioptric systems, pushbroom sensors, or theoretically proposed designs that have yet to find practical implementation. The framework's generality means future camera innovations require no fundamental changes to the projection pipeline.

**Reality Check**: For a standard pinhole camera rendering to a planar viewport, the matrix approach remains computationally superior—fewer operations, better memory locality, hardware optimization. A typical perspective projection requires ~15 floating-point operations via matrices versus ~80 operations using conformal GA. The GA approach provides value when:
- Working with non-standard cameras (spherical, cylindrical, cross-slits)
- Mixing multiple camera types in one system
- The overhead of representation conversion dominates computation
- Exploring novel camera models where flexibility matters

#### Ray Tracing: Architectural Unity Versus Raw Speed

Ray tracing exemplifies both the promise and reality of geometric unification. Traditional ray tracers maintain specialized intersection routines that exploit primitive-specific optimizations:
- Ray-sphere uses the quadratic formula directly
- Ray-plane reduces to a simple division
- Ray-triangle leverages barycentric coordinates

These optimizations matter. Production ray tracers process billions of ray-primitive tests. A 10% improvement in ray-triangle intersection can reduce render time by hours on complex scenes.

The GA approach replaces this proliferation with a single operation. The architectural simplification is clear—one algorithm replaces dozens. However, the computational reality must be acknowledged:

**Performance Analysis**:
- Specialized ray-sphere: ~30 floating-point operations
- GA ray-sphere meet: ~150 operations (including dual computations)
- Overhead factor: ~5×

This overhead isn't acceptable for production rendering of billion-triangle scenes. Where GA ray tracing provides value:

1. **Research renderers** exploring novel geometric primitives
2. **Educational systems** where clarity outweighs performance
3. **Prototyping** where development speed matters more than render time
4. **Differentiable rendering** where consistent gradient computation matters
5. **Small scenes** where the architectural benefits dominate

For differentiable rendering in particular, GA provides significant advantages. The meet operation has a consistent geometric interpretation across all primitive types, making gradient computation more uniform and reducing the special-case handling that plagues traditional differentiable ray tracers. Consider neural radiance fields (NeRF) and similar techniques that require computing gradients through the entire rendering pipeline—GA's uniform treatment of intersections simplifies automatic differentiation significantly.

#### Illumination: Richer Physical Representation

Traditional rendering separates light into components—intensity, direction, color—handling each through separate systems. The Lambertian diffuse model computes:

$$I = \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l}) \times \text{light\_color} \times \text{surface\_color}$$

This works well for point lights and diffuse surfaces, forming the backbone of real-time rendering. But physical light has richer structure. Electromagnetic fields are fundamentally bivector quantities encoding orientation in space, not just direction.

GA enables a more physically complete light representation:

$$L = L_0 + L_2$$

where $L_0$ captures traditional direction and intensity while $L_2$ is a bivector encoding the light's spatial extent and polarization. The illumination calculation becomes:

$$I = \langle N L_0 \rangle_0 + \frac{1}{2}\langle N L_2 N \rangle_0$$

The second term—impossible to express cleanly in vector algebra—captures how surface orientation interacts with extended light sources.

This bivector formulation doesn't replace Lambertian shading—it extends it. For point lights, the bivector term vanishes and we recover standard diffuse lighting. For area sources, we get analytical soft shadows without stochastic sampling. This mathematical framework naturally extends to phenomena difficult to capture in traditional formulations: polarized light transport, coherent illumination effects, and even some quantum optical phenomena when appropriately extended.

**Table 33: Illumination Model Evolution**

| Model | Traditional Formula | GA Enhancement | Computational Cost | Physical Accuracy |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Lambert | $\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l}$ | $\langle NL \rangle_0$ | Baseline | Point lights only |
| Phong | $(\mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v})^n$ | Rotor reflection | 1.2× | Empirical |
| Blinn-Phong | $(\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{h})^n$ | Half-vector bivector | 1.1× | Energy conserving |
| Area lights | Monte Carlo sampling | Bivector integration | 2× | Analytic solution |
| Polarization | Separate system | Natural in bivector | 1.5× | Physically complete |

The bivector approach extends naturally to BSDFs (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Functions). Traditional BSDFs parameterize scattering as functions on the hemisphere. GA BSDFs operate on bivectors, naturally encoding polarization and coherence effects that are awkward to express in traditional frameworks.

#### Structure from Motion: Manifold Elegance vs. Sparse Reality

Computer vision's structure-from-motion reconstructs 3D geometry from 2D images. Current approaches face well-known challenges in parameterizing rotations for optimization:
- Quaternions require explicit normalization after updates
- Rotation and translation optimize separately, reducing conditioning
- Gauge freedom requires fixing arbitrary cameras
- Near-singular configurations need special handling

The motor parameterization provides concrete engineering advantages:

1. **No constraints** - The exponential map automatically preserves unit versors
2. **Unified parameters** - Rotation and translation couple naturally
3. **Better conditioning** - The coupled system has superior numerical properties
4. **Smooth manifold** - No gimbal lock or quaternion double cover issues

**Table 34: Bundle Adjustment Comparison**

| Aspect | Quaternion + Translation | Motor (GA) | Advantage |
|--------|-------------------------|------------|-----------|
| Parameters | 7 per camera (4+3) | 6 per camera | Minimal parameterization |
| Constraints | $\|q\| = 1$ enforced | None needed | Simpler optimization |
| Update | Multiplicative + additive | Pure multiplicative | Geometric consistency |
| Jacobian | Complex chain rule | Natural in Lie algebra | Simpler derivatives |
| Implementation | Widely available | Requires GA library | Ecosystem consideration |

The motor approach requires approximately 15% more computation per iteration but converges in significantly fewer iterations due to better conditioning. The net result is comparable or slightly better total runtime with improved numerical stability.

##### Manifold Elegance vs. Sparse Reality

While motor parameterization provides elegant local representation, modern bundle adjustment's performance comes from global optimization strategies that GA currently cannot match. **GA lacks a native representation for the concept of conditional independence, making it architecturally incompatible with modern SLAM backends that rely on the immense computational advantages of sparse factor graph structures (e.g., g2o, GTSAM).**

The performance of these backends comes from specialized numerical techniques that exploit sparsity. **While GA elegantly represents the geometric constraints on the manifold, modern bundle adjustment solvers gain their performance from sparse matrix factorization techniques, such as the Schur complement trick, which have no direct equivalent in the dense operational structure of multivector algebra.**

Consider the computational reality:
- A typical SLAM problem might have 10,000 poses and 100,000 landmarks
- The Hessian matrix would be 36 million × 36 million if dense
- Factor graph sparsity reduces this to ~1 million non-zero entries
- Specialized solvers exploit this structure for sub-second solutions

The GA formulation, with its dense multivector operations, cannot currently compete with this level of optimization. The motor representation excels for small, dense problems where its superior local parameterization leads to faster convergence. For large-scale, sparse problems, traditional factor graph systems remain the state of the art.

This limitation reflects a deeper mathematical truth. Just as the gamma function extends factorials to non-integer dimensions, suggesting a continuous geometry underlying discrete structures, the sparse patterns in vision problems encode fundamental independence relationships that GA's continuous geometric framework doesn't naturally capture. The challenge isn't merely computational but conceptual—finding a geometric interpretation of conditional independence that preserves GA's elegance while enabling sparse computation.

##### The Deterministic Blind Spot: GA and Geometric Uncertainty

The GA framework, as presented, is fundamentally deterministic. This creates a critical gap in probabilistic vision applications where uncertainty propagation is essential.

**A fundamental operation in any probabilistic vision pipeline is the propagation of uncertainty. For instance, propagating a 6DOF pose covariance ellipsoid through a motor-based kinematic chain requires falling back on external Jacobian computations to manipulate the covariance matrix. Geometric Algebra itself provides no native mechanism for transforming a probability distribution represented by this ellipsoid; the versor mechanism $VXV^{-1}$ acts on points, not on distributions.**

This limitation manifests throughout visual computing:
- **Feature matching** requires representing match uncertainty
- **Triangulation** must propagate measurement noise to 3D points
- **SLAM** maintains beliefs over poses and landmarks
- **Sensor fusion** combines measurements with different uncertainties

Consider a concrete example: marginalizing out old poses in a sliding-window SLAM system. Traditional probabilistic frameworks handle this through Schur complement operations on the information matrix. GA offers no geometric equivalent to marginalization—a fundamentally probabilistic operation with no deterministic geometric interpretation.

The mature, hybrid solution uses GA as a clean representation layer for the state estimate itself, but converts this state to traditional matrix and vector forms for use in standard probabilistic estimators like the Kalman Filter (EKF/UKF) or for integration into factor graph backends. This conversion overhead further limits GA's applicability in real-time probabilistic systems.

#### Implementation Realities

Adopting GA for visual computing requires honest assessment of practical concerns:

**Memory Layout**: Multivectors in conformal space require careful organization for GPU efficiency:

GPU memory coalescing requires consecutive threads to access consecutive memory locations. Scattered multivector components break this pattern, causing significant performance degradation. Careful data structure design can mitigate but not eliminate this overhead.

**Performance Profiling**: Real-world performance depends heavily on specific operations and problem structure:

| Operation | Traditional Time | Motor Time | Motor/Traditional Ratio | When to Use GA |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Project point | 15 ops | 80 ops | 5.3× | Non-planar image surfaces |
| Ray-triangle test | 40 ops | 200 ops | 5× | Mixed primitive types |
| Compose transforms | 64 ops | 48 ops | 0.75× | Long transformation chains |
| Optimize camera | Complex | Natural | ~1× | Always beneficial |
| Interpolation Step | 5 ops | 10 ops | 2× | Smooth trajectories |

#### When to Adopt GA for Visual Computing

GA provides tangible benefits for specific visual computing scenarios:

**Use GA when**:
- Building systems that integrate graphics and vision
- Implementing differentiable rendering pipelines
- Working with non-standard camera models
- Requiring geometric consistency across operations
- Numerical stability matters more than raw speed
- Exploring novel algorithms where clarity aids development

**Continue with traditional methods when**:
- Optimizing fixed rendering pipelines
- Working exclusively with triangle meshes
- Deep integration with GPU frameworks is required
- Team expertise is limited to standard tools
- Performance requirements are stringent
- Probabilistic reasoning is central to the application

**Consider hybrid approaches**:
- Use GA for high-level scene structure
- Optimize inner loops with traditional methods
- Maintain GA "shadow" calculations for validation
- Gradually migrate components as benefits prove out

#### Frontier Applications: Where GA's Generality Shines

Beyond established applications, GA's framework naturally extends to emerging areas of visual computing:

**Neural Rendering and Implicit Representations**: Neural radiance fields and similar techniques benefit from GA's uniform treatment of geometric primitives. The ability to differentiate through the meet operation provides cleaner gradients than special-case intersection code.

**Computational Photography**: Multi-view imaging systems with unconventional camera arrangements—light field cameras, coded aperture systems, time-of-flight arrays—find natural expression in GA's unified projection framework.

**AR/VR Rendering**: The seamless integration of virtual and real geometry benefits from GA's consistent treatment of all geometric entities. Occlusion reasoning, portal rendering, and non-Euclidean spaces for VR experiences all find cleaner expression.

**Quantum Imaging**: As imaging systems begin to exploit quantum effects, the bivector representation of electromagnetic fields provides a natural bridge between classical geometric optics and quantum formulations.

These frontier applications often involve small-scale prototypes where GA's expressiveness outweighs performance concerns. As these technologies mature and performance requirements tighten, the familiar pattern emerges: hybrid architectures that use GA for high-level structure while optimizing critical paths with specialized algorithms.

#### The Balanced Perspective

Geometric algebra offers genuine value for visual computing, particularly when problems span the graphics-vision boundary. The framework provides a coherent geometric language that can reduce architectural friction in systems requiring consistent geometric reasoning across rendering and reconstruction.

However, this coherence comes with clear costs. GA operations typically require 3-5× more floating-point operations than specialized algorithms. The learning curve requires understanding homogeneous coordinates, quaternions, and Lie groups combined. Current library support remains less mature than established tools like Eigen or OpenCV. Most critically, the absence of probabilistic extensions severely limits applicability in modern vision systems where uncertainty is pervasive.

The practical sweet spot for GA in visual computing:
- Research into novel view synthesis and rendering algorithms
- Systems requiring geometric consistency across multiple domains
- Problems involving non-standard camera geometries
- Educational contexts where conceptual clarity matters
- Prototyping where development speed outweighs runtime performance
- Differentiable rendering where uniform gradient computation is valuable
- Small to medium-scale problems where sparse optimization isn't critical

For production systems with fixed requirements and tight performance constraints, traditional methods often remain optimal. For large-scale reconstruction and SLAM, sparse factor graph methods dominate. The engineering decision balances architectural elegance and numerical robustness against raw performance, ecosystem maturity, and the ability to handle uncertainty.

As visual computing increasingly merges graphics and vision—in AR/VR, neural rendering, and computational photography—the value of consistent geometric reasoning grows. GA provides one mathematical foundation for such systems, trading computational efficiency and probabilistic completeness for architectural coherence when that tradeoff aligns with project requirements.
