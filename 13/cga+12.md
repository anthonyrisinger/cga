## Part III: Domain Applications

Geometric algebra's theoretical elegance meets domain-specific reality. Each field brings unique constraints—hardware architectures, performance requirements, legacy systems, and cultural expectations. These chapters examine where GA's mathematical unity translates to practical value and where it doesn't.

The verdict varies dramatically by domain. Machine learning embraces GA's natural equivariance. Robotics finds alignment with screw theory. Graphics fights hardware lock-in. Physics trades computation for clarity. Understanding these nuances enables informed adoption decisions.

### Chapter 12: Machine Learning—Natural Equivariance

Traditional neural networks waste millions of parameters learning that the laws of physics don't change when you rotate your coordinate system. A network trained to predict molecular forces must learn—from data alone—that rotating a molecule 90° rotates the forces 90°. This isn't deep learning; it's remedial geometry that consumes training data, computational resources, and model capacity.

Geometric algebra builds this knowledge directly into the network architecture. When data flows through GA layers as multivectors rather than vectors, equivariance emerges from the algebraic structure rather than learned parameters.

#### Why Networks Struggle with Symmetry

Consider training a network to predict forces on atoms in a molecule. The training set contains the molecule in one orientation:

$$\text{Input: } \mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_n \quad \text{Output: } \mathbf{f}_1, \mathbf{f}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{f}_n$$

At test time, the same molecule appears rotated by $R$:

$$\text{Input: } R\mathbf{r}_1, R\mathbf{r}_2, \ldots, R\mathbf{r}_n$$

The physics demands:

$$\text{Output: } R\mathbf{f}_1, R\mathbf{f}_2, \ldots, R\mathbf{f}_n$$

A standard neural network sees these as completely different inputs. The weight matrix $W$ in $\mathbf{y} = W\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ doesn't know that rotation is special—it's just numbers multiplying numbers.

Traditional solutions each impose costs:

**Data augmentation**: Generate every possible rotation during training. For full SO(3) coverage, this multiplies training time by 10-100×. You're teaching the network what rotation means through brute force repetition.

**Architectural constraints**: SE(3)-Transformers and E(n)-GNNs build equivariance through careful engineering—spherical harmonics, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, message passing constraints. These work but require deep expertise and sacrifice expressiveness for correctness.

**Loss penalties**: Add terms like $\mathcal{L}_{\text{equiv}} = \|f(Rx) - Rf(x)\|^2$ to encourage equivariant behavior. This provides no guarantees—when the main loss dominates, equivariance degrades.

#### The Multivector Alternative

Chapter 6 showed how motors unify rotation and translation. Chapter 2 revealed rotations as double reflections. These geometric insights now power neural architectures.

In Projective Geometric Algebra, we embed a 3D point as a null vector:

$$P = x e_1 + y e_2 + z e_3 + e_0$$

This lives in the 16-dimensional space $\mathbb{G}_{3,0,1}$. When we rotate by rotor $R$, the transformation follows the sandwich pattern:

$$P' = R P \tilde{R}$$

The crucial property: geometric products preserve this structure.

**Equivariance Theorem**: Let $f$ be any function built from geometric products and linear combinations. Then:

$$f(RX\tilde{R}) = R f(X) \tilde{R}$$

**Proof**: We proceed by structural induction.

*Base case*: Linear combinations preserve the sandwich structure:
$$\alpha(RX\tilde{R}) + \beta(RY\tilde{R}) = R(\alpha X + \beta Y)\tilde{R}$$

*Inductive step*: The geometric product distributes over sandwiches:
$$(RX\tilde{R})(RY\tilde{R}) = RX(\tilde{R}R)Y\tilde{R} = RXY\tilde{R}$$

since $\tilde{R}R = 1$ for unit rotors. By induction, any composition of products and linear operations maintains equivariance. □

This isn't learned behavior—it's algebraic necessity. The network cannot violate rotational symmetry because the mathematics forbids it.

#### GATr: Transformers in Geometric Algebra

Qualcomm AI Research's Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr) implements this principle at scale. Instead of attention over vectors $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, GATr performs attention over multivectors $V \in \mathbb{G}_{3,0,1}$.

The architecture replaces matrix multiplications with motor transformations:

```cpp
// Traditional attention: breaks equivariance
Vector attention_classic(const Vector& x) {
    return W_v * (W_k * x) * softmax(W_q * x);  // W matrices don't preserve rotation
}

// GATr attention: inherently equivariant
template<int N>
struct GeometricAttention {
    Motor<N> M_q, M_k, M_v;  // Learned motors (not matrices)

    Multivector<N> operator()(const Multivector<N>& X) const {
        // Transform via sandwich products
        auto Q = M_q(X);  // M_q * X * ~M_q
        auto K = M_k(X);
        auto V = M_v(X);

        // Geometric product for attention scores
        float score = (Q * K).grade_0();  // Scalar part = rotation-invariant

        return softmax(score) * V;
    }
};
```

Every operation preserves equivariance by construction. Rotate the input, and all intermediate values rotate accordingly—automatically.

#### Understanding the Overhead

The 16× computational overhead has three sources:

**1. Dimensional expansion** (5.3×):
$$\text{3D vector: } \underbrace{[x, y, z]}_{\text{3 floats}} \quad \rightarrow \quad \text{PGA multivector: } \underbrace{[s, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_{23}, e_{31}, e_{12}, \ldots]}_{\text{16 floats}}$$

**2. Product complexity** (3×):
$$\begin{align}
\text{Dot product: } \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} &= \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i b_i \quad \text{(3 mults, 2 adds)} \\
\text{Geometric product: } A * B &= \sum_{i,j} A_i B_j e_i e_j \quad \text{(48 mults, 40 adds)}
\end{align}$$

**3. Total overhead**: $5.3 \times 3 \approx 16×$ for naive implementation

But sparsity changes everything. A point in PGA has only 4 non-zero components:

$$P = \underbrace{x e_1 + y e_2 + z e_3 + e_0}_{\text{4 non-zero}} + \underbrace{0 \cdot e_{23} + 0 \cdot e_{31} + \cdots}_{\text{12 zeros}}$$

Exploiting this sparsity:

```cpp
// Sparse point representation
struct PGAPoint {
    float x, y, z;  // e1, e2, e3 coefficients
    static constexpr float e0 = 1.0f;  // Always 1 for normalized points

    // Product with another point: ~22 FLOPs (not 88)
    Multivector<16> operator*(const PGAPoint& other) const {
        // Only compute non-zero grade interactions
        float scalar = x*other.x + y*other.y + z*other.z;
        Bivector grade2 = {
            x*other.y - y*other.x,  // e12
            y*other.z - z*other.y,  // e23
            z*other.x - x*other.z   // e31
        };
        // Higher grades remain zero
        return {scalar, {x, y, z}, grade2, 0, 0};
    }
};
```

The effective overhead drops to 3-5× for typical operations—steep but manageable.

#### Empirical Results: Data Efficiency

On n-body charged particle simulation, GATr demonstrates dramatic improvements:

$$\begin{align}
\text{Standard Transformer:} \quad & \text{100,000 training samples} \rightarrow \text{0.0098 RMSE} \\
\text{GATr:} \quad & \text{10,000 training samples} \rightarrow \text{0.0035 RMSE}
\end{align}$$

With 10× less data, GATr achieves 2.8× better accuracy. Why? The standard transformer wastes its first 90,000 samples learning that physics has rotational symmetry. GATr knows this from its architecture.

For molecular property prediction, consider predicting the dipole moment of aspirin (C₉H₈O₄):

$$\mu = \sum_{i=1}^{21} q_i \mathbf{r}_i$$

Under rotation $R$:

$$\mu' = \sum_{i=1}^{21} q_i (R\mathbf{r}_i) = R\left(\sum_{i=1}^{21} q_i \mathbf{r}_i\right) = R\mu$$

GATr maintains this relationship exactly:

```cpp
// Test equivariance on aspirin molecule
auto atoms = load_molecule("C9H8O4");
auto dipole_original = gatr_model(atoms);

// Apply random rotation
Motor R = random_rotation();
auto atoms_rotated = transform_all(atoms, R);
auto dipole_rotated = gatr_model(atoms_rotated);

// Verify: dipole rotates with molecule
float error = norm(dipole_rotated - R(dipole_original));
assert(error < 1e-5);  // Exact to numerical precision
```

Standard networks achieve 5-15% error under rotation. GATr maintains <0.1% automatically.

#### When Geometry Dominates

GA networks excel when geometric structure defines the problem:

**Strong indicators**:
- Inputs/outputs transform predictably under rotation/translation
- Limited training data (<10K examples)
- Test data includes orientations never seen during training
- Physical consistency matters more than raw accuracy

**Concrete domains**: Molecular dynamics, robotic manipulation, medical imaging, fluid simulation, crystallography

**Poor fits**:
- No natural geometric structure (language, recommender systems)
- Massive datasets where augmentation costs nothing
- Latency requirements under 10ms (even optimized GA needs 3-5× more time)
- Teams without mathematical sophistication

The key insight from Chapter 11: don't force geometric structure where none exists. GA is powerful when geometry is fundamental, not incidental.

#### Production Considerations

Deploying GA networks requires careful engineering:

**1. Memory layout matters more than FLOPs**:
```cpp
// Poor: Array of structures (cache misses)
struct TokenArray {
    Multivector<16> tokens[1024];  // Scattered memory access
};

// Better: Structure of arrays (cache friendly)
struct TokenBatch {
    alignas(64) float scalar[1024];      // Grade 0 components together
    alignas(64) float e1[1024];          // Grade 1 components...
    alignas(64) float e2[1024];
    alignas(64) float e3[1024];
    // ... organized by grade for SIMD
};
```

**2. Hybrid architectures are practical**:
```cpp
class MolecularPredictor {
    // Standard GNN extracts features
    GraphNetwork feature_extractor;

    // GA transformer reasons about geometry
    GATr geometric_reasoner;

    // Standard MLP predicts properties
    MLP property_head;

    float predict_property(const Molecule& mol) {
        auto features = feature_extractor(mol.graph);      // No GA overhead
        auto ga_tokens = embed_as_multivectors(features);  // Convert at boundary
        auto geometric = geometric_reasoner(ga_tokens);    // GA where it matters
        return property_head(geometric.to_vector());       // Back to standard
    }
};
```

**3. Understand the competition**:

GATr competes with OTHER geometric approaches, not vanilla transformers:

| Method | Sample Efficiency | Inference Speed | Implementation Complexity |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Data Augmentation | 1× (baseline) | Fast | Trivial |
| SE(3)-Transformer | 3-5× | 2× slower | High (spherical harmonics) |
| E(n)-GNN | 5-7× | 1.5× slower | Medium (message constraints) |
| GATr | 10× | 3-5× slower | Medium (multivectors) |

Choose based on your constraints. If you have millions of training examples, use augmentation. If you have thousands, GA's sample efficiency justifies the overhead.

#### The Deeper Pattern

This chapter demonstrates GA's fundamental trade-off in its purest form. We accept 3-5× computational overhead to gain:

- 10× better sample efficiency
- Exact equivariance without engineering
- Interpretable geometric features
- Guaranteed physical consistency

Chapter 10 established that GA cannot represent uncertainty. This means GA networks excel at deterministic physical systems but cannot quantify their confidence. The practical solution: use GA layers for geometric reasoning within a probabilistic framework:

```cpp
class UncertainMolecularPredictor {
    GATr geometric_core;      // Deterministic geometry
    BayesianMLP uncertainty;  // Probabilistic wrapper

    Distribution<float> predict(const Molecule& mol) {
        auto features = geometric_core(mol);  // GA for structure
        return uncertainty(features);         // Standard for uncertainty
    }
};
```

For problems dominated by geometric structure—where knowing the physics matters more than quantifying uncertainty—geometric algebra transforms how we build neural networks. The overhead is real. The benefits are transformative. The choice, as always, depends on what matters most for your problem.
