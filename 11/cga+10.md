### Chapter 10: Robotics and Kinematics: The Motor Algebra

Robotic systems coordinate multiple rigid transformations—rotations at joints, translations along links, and their composition into end-effector motion. Traditional approaches fragment this natural unity: quaternions handle rotation, vectors represent translation, and 4×4 homogeneous matrices combine them with careful maintenance of orthogonality constraints.

This fragmentation creates genuine engineering challenges. Quaternion interpolation cannot represent coupled rotation-translation paths. Homogeneous matrices accumulate numerical errors requiring periodic orthogonalization. Euler angle representations exhibit gimbal lock singularities. Each representation excels within its domain but requires conversion at interfaces.

Geometric algebra's motor representation unifies rigid transformations through the mathematical structure of screw motion. This chapter develops motor algebra from fundamental principles, analyzes its computational requirements, and demonstrates specific applications where motors provide engineering advantages.

#### Screw Motion: The Mathematical Foundation

Every rigid body displacement equals a screw motion—simultaneous rotation about and translation along an axis. This result, proven by Michel Chasles in 1830, means screw motions aren't one transformation type among many but the fundamental building block of spatial motion.

Consider a door opening: it rotates about the hinge axis while each point traces a helix. A falling screw spins while translating downward. Pure rotation (zero pitch) and pure translation (infinite pitch) are limiting cases of the general screw.

Traditional robotics acknowledges this mathematical fact then immediately fragments it. Joint rotations use quaternions or rotation matrices. Link translations use position vectors. The natural screw structure disappears into separate components requiring careful reassembly.

#### Motors: Unified Screw Representation

In conformal geometric algebra, a motor encodes complete screw motion in a single mathematical object:

$$M = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\theta L^* + d\mathbf{n}_\infty)\right)$$

where:
- $L$ represents the screw axis as a line in conformal space
- $\theta$ is the rotation angle about this axis
- $d$ is the translation distance along the axis
- $L^*$ denotes the dual of the line (converting from OPNS to IPNS representation)
- $\mathbf{n}_\infty$ is the conformal point at infinity

This formula unifies rotation and translation into one exponential map. For pure rotation about the origin, $d = 0$ and the motor reduces to a rotor. For pure translation, the axis moves to infinity and the motor becomes a translator.

The motor transforms any geometric object—point, line, plane, sphere—through the sandwich product:

$$X' = MXM^{-1}$$

This single operation correctly handles all geometric primitives without special cases. A motor that rotates points also rotates lines, planes, and spheres consistently. This preservation of complete geometric information exemplifies the book's central theme: the geometric product maintains all relationships where traditional methods project onto subspaces.

#### Computational Requirements

**Storage**: Motors require 8 floats (sparse representation possible with 6-7 non-zero components):
- Scalar part: 1 float
- Bivector parts (6 components): typically 3-4 non-zero
- Quadvector part: 1 float

Compare to:
- Quaternion + translation: 7 floats
- 4×4 homogeneous matrix: 16 floats (12 essential)
- Dual quaternion: 8 floats

**Operations**: Applying a motor via sandwich product:
- Extract relevant grades: ~20 FLOPs
- First geometric product $MX$: ~100 FLOPs
- Second geometric product $(MX)M^{-1}$: ~100 FLOPs
- Total: ~220 FLOPs

Compare to:
- Matrix-vector multiply: 12 FLOPs
- Quaternion rotation + translation: ~30 FLOPs

The motor approach requires approximately 7× more operations but provides unified handling of all geometric primitives and superior numerical properties.

#### Motor Composition and Decomposition

Motors compose through multiplication:
$$M_{total} = M_n \cdots M_3 M_2 M_1$$

This multiplication preserves the screw structure—the composition of screw motions is another screw motion. The non-commutativity correctly captures that rotation and translation order matters.

**Motor Decomposition**: Given a motor $M$, extract its rotational and translational components:

1. **Normalize to extract rotation**:
   $$R = \frac{M}{\sqrt{\langle M\tilde{M} \rangle_0}}$$

2. **Extract translation**:
   $$T = M\tilde{R}$$

This decomposition requires ~50 FLOPs and provides the rotation as a unit rotor and translation as a translator.

#### Forward Kinematics Analysis

Consider a 6-DOF robot arm. Each joint contributes a motor:
- Revolute joint rotating by angle $\theta_i$ about axis $L_i$:
  $$M_i = \exp\left(-\frac{\theta_i}{2}L_i^*\right)$$
- Prismatic joint translating distance $d_i$ along direction $\mathbf{v}_i$:
  $$M_i = \exp\left(-\frac{d_i}{2}\mathbf{v}_i\mathbf{n}_\infty\right) = 1 - \frac{d_i}{2}\mathbf{v}_i\mathbf{n}_\infty$$

The total transformation from base to end-effector:
$$M_{total} = M_6 M_5 M_4 M_3 M_2 M_1$$

**Computational Comparison**:

Traditional DH parameters multiply 4×4 matrices:
- Per joint: Matrix multiply = 64 FLOPs
- 6 joints: 384 FLOPs total
- Numerical drift accumulates, requiring periodic Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

Motor composition:
- Per joint: Motor multiply = 48 FLOPs
- 6 joints: 288 FLOPs for composition
- Plus 220 FLOPs to apply to end-effector
- Total: ~508 FLOPs

Motors require 1.3× more computation but maintain rigid body constraints exactly. The geometric product's structure ensures $M\tilde{M} = \text{scalar}$ to first order under small perturbations—superior to matrix orthogonality degradation. For long kinematic chains or extended operation without recalibration, this numerical stability becomes invaluable.

#### Velocity Kinematics and Jacobians

The velocity relationship in motor form:
$$\dot{M} = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{\theta}_i B_i M$$

where $B_i$ are the instantaneous screw axes expressed as bivectors. For revolute joint $i$:
$$B_i = -\frac{1}{2}L_i^*$$

For prismatic joint $i$:
$$B_i = -\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{v}_i\mathbf{n}_\infty$$

The geometric Jacobian maps joint velocities to end-effector velocity:
$$V_{ee} = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{\theta}_i (B_i \times P_{ee})$$

This formulation unifies linear and angular velocity naturally—both emerge from the bivector structure. Traditional approaches split into separate 3×3 blocks for linear and angular components, obscuring the underlying screw motion.

#### Singularity Detection and Classification

Kinematic singularities occur when the robot loses degrees of freedom. GA provides both detection and geometric classification through the meet operation. See Appendix B.7 for complete singularity detection formulas.

The key insight: singularities correspond to geometric degeneracies detectable through incidence operations. When three revolute axes meet at a point, the wrist loses a rotational DOF. When two axes become parallel, their wedge product vanishes. These geometric conditions directly translate to algebraic tests.

**Example: Wrist Singularity Detection**

For three revolute axes $L_4, L_5, L_6$ potentially intersecting:
$$P_{intersection} = L_4 \vee L_5 \vee L_6$$

If this meet operation produces a non-null result (a point), the axes intersect and the wrist is singular. The computation requires ~300 FLOPs but provides geometric insight into the singularity's nature, enabling targeted avoidance strategies.

#### Path Planning and Interpolation

Motor interpolation provides natural screw motion paths. The exponential/logarithm relationship enables smooth trajectories:

**Motor Logarithm**: For motor $M = \cos\frac{\phi}{2} + S\sin\frac{\phi}{2}$ where $S$ is a unit bivector:
$$\log(M) = \frac{\phi}{2}S$$

This extracts the screw axis and motion parameters (~200 FLOPs).

**Motor Interpolation**: Given initial motor $M_0$ and final motor $M_1$:
$$M(t) = M_0\exp\left(t\log(M_0^{-1}M_1)\right)$$

This produces constant-speed screw motion from $M_0$ to $M_1$. Traditional separate interpolation of rotation and translation cannot achieve this natural motion.

See Appendix B.8 for complete interpolation schemes including quadratic, cubic, and minimum-jerk trajectories.

#### Inverse Kinematics

The inverse kinematics problem—finding joint angles for desired end-effector pose—remains computationally challenging regardless of representation. Motors provide advantages in formulation:

**Error Motor**: Given desired pose $M_d$ and current pose $M_c$:
$$M_e = M_d M_c^{-1}$$

The error motor directly encodes the required displacement as a screw motion. Taking the logarithm:
$$\log(M_e) = \frac{1}{2}(\theta L^* + d\mathbf{n}_\infty)$$

This extracts both rotational error (angle $\theta$ about axis $L$) and translational error (distance $d$ along axis) in unified form.

**Iterative Update**: The Jacobian relates joint velocities to motor velocity:
$$\dot{M}_e = -\sum_{i=1}^n \dot{\theta}_i B_i M_e$$

Solving for joint updates that drive $M_e \to 1$ (identity motor).

**Computational Cost**:
- Motor logarithm: ~200 FLOPs
- Error computation: ~50 FLOPs
- Jacobian solve: ~150 FLOPs
- Per iteration: ~400 FLOPs

Traditional methods separating rotation and translation errors require ~150 FLOPs per iteration. Motors require 2.7× more computation but provide unified error representation and superior behavior near singularities where rotation and translation couple strongly.

#### Dynamics Extension

While kinematics ignores forces, real robots require dynamic modeling. The motor framework extends naturally through bivector representations:

**Momentum Bivector**:
$$\mathcal{P} = m(\mathbf{v} \wedge \mathbf{n}_0) + \mathbf{L}$$

This unifies linear momentum $m\mathbf{v}$ (through the $\mathbf{v} \wedge \mathbf{n}_0$ term) and angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ as aspects of screw momentum. Under rigid transformation by motor $M$:
$$\mathcal{P}' = M\mathcal{P}M^{-1}$$

The sandwich product correctly transforms both components simultaneously.

**Wrench Bivector**:
$$\mathcal{W} = \mathbf{f} \wedge \mathbf{n}_0 + \boldsymbol{\tau}$$

Forces $\mathbf{f}$ and torques $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ combine into a single wrench—the dual of a screw motion. The power delivered:
$$P = \langle \mathcal{W} \cdot \mathcal{V} \rangle_0$$

where $\mathcal{V}$ is the velocity bivector corresponding to the motor derivative.

This formulation provides coordinate-free dynamics. The bivector products naturally handle the cross-products that appear in traditional formulations. Computational cost is comparable to spatial vector algebra (6×6 matrix methods) at ~220 FLOPs per dynamics step.

#### Worked Example: 2-DOF Planar Arm

Consider a planar 2-link arm with:
- Link lengths: $l_1 = l_2 = 1$
- Joint angles: $\theta_1 = \pi/4$, $\theta_2 = \pi/3$

**Step 1: Joint Motors**

First joint (rotation about origin):
$$M_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\pi/8}\mathbf{e}_{12}\right)$$

Using $\exp(\theta B) = \cos\theta + B\sin\theta$ for unit bivector $B$:
$$M_1 = \cos(\pi/8) - \mathbf{e}_{12}\sin(\pi/8) = 0.924 - 0.383\mathbf{e}_{12}$$

Second joint (rotation about $(1,0)$ after first rotation):
- Axis at link 1 endpoint after $M_1$: $P_1 = M_1(\mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{n}_0)M_1^{-1}$
- Computing: $P_1 = 0.707\mathbf{e}_1 + 0.707\mathbf{e}_2 + \text{conformal terms}$

The second motor combines rotation and the required translation.

**Step 2: End-Effector Position**

After complete calculation:
$$P_{ee} = M_2M_1(\mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{n}_0)(M_2M_1)^{-1}$$

Results in position $(0.793, 1.573)$ in the plane.

**Step 3: Verification**

Traditional calculation:
- After $\theta_1$: $(0.707, 0.707)$
- After $\theta_2$: $(0.707 + \cos(\pi/4 + \pi/3), 0.707 + \sin(\pi/4 + \pi/3))$
- Result: $(0.793, 1.573)$ ✓

The motor calculation requires more operations (~500 FLOPs vs ~50 FLOPs) but maintains exact rigid body constraints and extends naturally to 3D without modification.

#### When to Deploy Motors

Motors excel for:
- Robots with 7+ DOF where numerical drift compounds
- Applications requiring extended operation without recalibration
- Systems with strong rotation-translation coupling (surgical robots, flight simulators)
- Novel mechanism design where flexibility matters
- Research into geometric properties of robot workspaces

Traditional methods remain optimal for:
- Standard 6-DOF industrial robots with mature control systems
- Real-time control with microsecond cycle times
- Simple pick-and-place in well-conditioned workspaces
- Teams with established DH parameter workflows

#### The Information Preservation Principle

Motors exemplify the book's central theme: the geometric product preserves complete geometric information where traditional methods fragment it. A screw motion—the fundamental building block of rigid transformation—remains whole in the motor representation. Quaternions capture only rotation; vectors only translation; homogeneous matrices combine them without preserving the screw structure.

This preservation has concrete benefits. Motor interpolation produces natural screw paths because the structure is maintained. Singularity analysis reveals geometric insight because the relationships aren't obscured by representation. Dynamics extends cleanly because momentum and force transform consistently.

The computational cost—typically 2-5× more operations—purchases this geometric clarity and numerical robustness. For systems where these properties matter more than raw speed, motors provide a powerful tool for robotic system design.
