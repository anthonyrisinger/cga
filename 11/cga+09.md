### Chapter 9: Visual Computing with Geometric Algebra

Computer graphics and computer vision evolved distinct mathematical toolkits. Graphics pipelines use 4×4 matrices for GPU-accelerated transformation, quaternions for smooth rotation interpolation, and specialized shading models tuned for real-time performance. Vision systems employ homogeneous coordinates for projective geometry, Plücker coordinates for 3D line representation, and manifold optimization techniques for reconstruction.

Systems spanning both domains face architectural friction. Visual SLAM integrates rendering pipelines with feature extraction and bundle adjustment. Augmented reality continuously transitions between pose estimation and scene synthesis. Each mathematical boundary introduces conversion overhead, synchronization complexity, and numerical error accumulation.

Geometric algebra provides a unified framework for visual computing. The same mathematical operations handle camera projection, ray intersection, illumination, and motion estimation. This unification comes at 5-10× computational cost compared to specialized methods. This chapter analyzes where architectural benefits justify performance penalties.

### Camera Models: Geometric Unification

Traditional camera models use projection matrices encoding intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. For a pinhole camera with focal length $f$, principal point $(c_x, c_y)$, and pose $[R|t]$:

$$P = K[R|t] = \begin{pmatrix} f & 0 & c_x \\ 0 & f & c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} R & t \\ 0^T & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

This matrix directly feeds GPU vertex shaders and leverages decades of hardware optimization.

Geometric algebra reconceptualizes cameras as geometric entities rather than transformations. A camera consists of:
- Optical center $C$ (a conformal point)
- Image surface $\Sigma$ (plane, sphere, cylinder, or other manifold)

Projection becomes geometric incidence:

$$\text{Project}(P) = (C \wedge P \wedge \mathbf{n}_\infty) \vee \Sigma$$

Let's work through a concrete example. For a pinhole camera at origin looking along +z with image plane at $z = 1$:

```
Camera center: C = n₀ (conformal origin)
Image plane: Σ = e₃ + n∞ (plane at z=1)
World point: P = 2e₁ + 3e₂ + 5e₃ + 14.5n∞ + n₀

Ray construction: C ∧ P ∧ n∞ = n₀ ∧ (2e₁ + 3e₂ + 5e₃) ∧ n∞
                            = 2(n₀ ∧ e₁ ∧ n∞) + 3(n₀ ∧ e₂ ∧ n∞) + 5(n₀ ∧ e₃ ∧ n∞)

Meet with plane: Ray ∨ Σ requires ~80 FLOPs
Result: Projected point at (2/5, 3/5, 1)
```

The same formula handles all camera types. For a spherical (fisheye) camera:
- $C$ = camera center
- $\Sigma$ = sphere of radius $r$
- Same projection formula, different surface

Cross-slits cameras demonstrate GA's elegance. These generate rays through two skew lines—useful for motion blur and certain scanning configurations. Traditional implementations require complex two-line parameterizations and special ray generation code. In GA:

$$C = L_1 \wedge L_2$$

The camera *is* the wedge of two lines. Ray generation follows naturally from the geometric constraint.

**Performance Analysis**: Matrix projection: ~15 FLOPs. GA projection: ~80 FLOPs. The 5× overhead buys geometric generality and unified architecture.

### Ray Tracing: Unification Versus Specialization

Ray tracing tests ray-primitive intersections billions of times per frame. Traditional implementations optimize each case:

```
Ray-sphere intersection:
  Substitute ray equation into sphere equation
  Solve quadratic: ~30 FLOPs

Ray-plane intersection:
  t = (d - ray.origin · plane.normal) / (ray.direction · plane.normal)
  ~10 FLOPs

Ray-triangle intersection (Möller-Trumbore):
  Barycentric coordinate test: ~40 FLOPs
```

GA replaces all specialized algorithms with the meet operation:

$$\text{Intersection} = \text{Ray} \vee \text{Primitive}$$

Computing ray-sphere intersection in GA:
```
Ray: R = P₁ ∧ P₂ ∧ n∞ (line through two points)
Sphere: S = C - ½r²n∞ (center C, radius r)

Meet computation:
1. Dual of ray: R* = R·I₅⁻¹ (~32 FLOPs)
2. Dual of sphere: S* = S·I₅⁻¹ (~32 FLOPs)
3. Wedge: R* ∧ S* (~64 FLOPs)
4. Final dual: (R* ∧ S*)* (~32 FLOPs)
Total: ~160 FLOPs
```

The 5× overhead seems prohibitive for production ray tracing. However, GA provides advantages in specific contexts:

**Differentiable Rendering**: Neural rendering techniques require gradients through the rendering pipeline. Traditional ray tracers must derive separate gradient formulas for each intersection type:
- $\nabla$(ray-sphere) differs from $\nabla$(ray-plane) differs from $\nabla$(ray-triangle)

GA provides unified gradients through one formula:
$$\nabla(\text{Ray} \vee \text{Primitive})$$

The meet operation's universal structure means automatic differentiation tools produce correct gradients for any primitive type without special cases.

**Novel Primitives**: Adding torus intersection to a traditional ray tracer requires:
1. Deriving ray-torus intersection algebra (quartic equation)
2. Implementing numerical solver for degree-4 polynomial
3. Optimizing for numerical stability
4. Testing edge cases

In GA, torus intersection works immediately through the existing meet operation.

### Bivector Illumination: Beyond Point Lights

Traditional rendering models light as intensity + direction + color. The Lambertian model computes:

$$I = \max(0, \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l}) \times I_{\text{light}} \times \rho_{\text{surface}}$$

This works for point lights but requires stochastic sampling for area sources.

Physical light has richer structure. Electromagnetic fields are fundamentally bivector quantities—oriented area elements in spacetime. GA enables modeling this structure:

$$L = L_0 + L_2$$

where:
- $L_0$: Traditional directional component (grade 1)
- $L_2$: Bivector encoding spatial extent (grade 2)

For surface point with normal $N$, illumination becomes:

$$I = \langle NL_0 \rangle_0 + \frac{1}{2}\langle NL_2N \rangle_0$$

Let's compute area light illumination:

```
Square area light: 1m × 1m at origin facing +z
Light bivector: L₂ = e₁∧e₂ (unit area in xy-plane)
Surface point: P = (0.5, 0.5, 1) with normal N = e₃

Traditional approach:
  Sample 100 points on light surface
  Compute 100 shadow rays
  Average contributions
  ~4000 FLOPs + stochastic noise

GA approach:
  I = ⟨N·L₀⟩₀ + ½⟨N·L₂·N⟩₀
    = 0 + ½⟨e₃·(e₁∧e₂)·e₃⟩₀
    = ½⟨-e₁∧e₂⟩₀
    = 0 (no contribution from extent term for parallel surfaces)
  ~200 FLOPs, exact result
```

For tilted surface normal $N = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\mathbf{e}_1 + \mathbf{e}_3)$:
```
½⟨N·L₂·N⟩₀ = ½⟨(e₁+e₃)·(e₁∧e₂)·(e₁+e₃)⟩₀/2
            = ½⟨(e₁+e₃)·(e₁∧e₂)·e₁ + (e₁+e₃)·(e₁∧e₂)·e₃⟩₀/2
            = ½⟨e₂ - e₁∧e₂∧e₃⟩₀/2
            = analytical soft shadow contribution
```

The bivector formulation computes analytical soft shadows without sampling. The 2× computational overhead eliminates noise and provides exact results.

### Bundle Adjustment: Superior Parameterization

Structure-from-motion optimizes camera poses and 3D points to minimize reprojection error. Traditional parameterizations face challenges:

```
Quaternion + translation (7 parameters, 1 constraint):
  - Normalize after each update: q ← q/||q||
  - Separate multiplicative/additive updates
  - Gimbal lock impossible but normalization drift occurs

Rotation matrix + translation (12 parameters, 6 constraints):
  - Orthogonalization required: R ← R(R^T R)^(-1/2)
  - Expensive constraint enforcement
  - Direct geometric meaning but redundant parameters
```

Motors provide unconstrained parameterization of rigid motion:

$$M = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\theta L^* + d\mathbf{n}_\infty)\right)$$

Bundle adjustment with motors:

```
Initial pose: M₀ = 1 (identity)
Desired update: Rotate 0.1 rad around z, translate (0.1, 0, 0)

Update bivector: B = -0.05(e₁∧e₂) - 0.05e₁n∞
Exponential: M_update = exp(B) = 1 + B + B²/2 + ...
                      ≈ 1 - 0.05(e₁∧e₂) - 0.05e₁n∞ (small angle)

New pose: M₁ = M_update · M₀ = M_update

Reprojection:
  World point: P_w = e₁ + 2e₂ + 3e₃ + 7n∞ + n₀
  Camera space: P_c = M₁ · P_w · M₁†
  Project: p = (C ∧ P_c ∧ n∞) ∨ Σ
```

The motor exponential naturally lives on the SE(3) manifold. No constraints needed—the exponential map guarantees valid rigid motions.

**Performance**: Each iteration requires ~15% more computation but converges in fewer iterations due to:
- Natural manifold structure (no constraint violations)
- Better numerical conditioning (no separate rotation/translation)
- Unified transformation (no quaternion/vector synchronization)

### The Sparsity Catastrophe

Modern vision systems achieve real-time performance through sparse optimization. Consider a SLAM problem:
- 10,000 camera poses (6 DOF each) = 60,000 parameters
- 100,000 landmarks (3 DOF each) = 300,000 parameters
- Total: 360,000 parameters

The Hessian matrix would be 360,000 × 360,000 = 130 billion entries if dense.

Factor graphs exploit conditional independence:
- Each camera connects only to visible landmarks
- Each landmark connects only to observing cameras
- Typical connectivity: ~1% of possible edges

Sparse representation stores only ~1 million non-zero entries—a 130,000× reduction. Specialized solvers (g2o, GTSAM) achieve sub-second solutions through:
- Schur complement for marginalization
- Variable ordering heuristics
- Sparse Cholesky decomposition

GA operations are inherently dense. The geometric product fills in zero entries:
```
Sparse motor: M = 1 - 0.1e₁n∞ (only 2 non-zero components)
Squared: M² = 1 - 0.2e₁n∞ + 0.01e₁n∞e₁n∞
            = 1 - 0.2e₁n∞ - 0.01n₀n∞  (3 components)
Cubed: M³ has 4 non-zero components
Pattern: Sparsity destroyed by geometric product
```

This fundamental incompatibility prevents GA from exploiting the sparse structure essential to modern vision. For problems under ~100 poses, GA's superior conditioning can outweigh the sparsity penalty. Beyond this scale, traditional sparse methods dominate.

### GPU Implementation Challenges

Graphics hardware expects specific memory layouts for optimal performance. Consider projecting 1 million points:

```
Traditional layout (Structure of Arrays):
  x: [x₁, x₂, ..., x₁₀₀₀₀₀₀]
  y: [y₁, y₂, ..., y₁₀₀₀₀₀₀]
  z: [z₁, z₂, ..., z₁₀₀₀₀₀₀]

  Coalesced access: Adjacent threads read adjacent memory

GA layout (Array of Structures):
  P₁: [x₁, y₁, z₁, 0, 0, ..., s₁, 0, ..., n₀_coeff, n∞_coeff]
  P₂: [x₂, y₂, z₂, 0, 0, ..., s₂, 0, ..., n₀_coeff, n∞_coeff]

  Scattered access: Adjacent threads read memory 32 floats apart
  3-5× slowdown from memory bandwidth alone
```

Optimization strategies:
- Pack only non-zero coefficients (reduces storage, complicates indexing)
- Separate operations by grade (better locality, more kernel launches)
- Hybrid storage for common cases (points always have same sparsity pattern)

Even with optimization, GA's scattered memory patterns conflict with GPU architecture designed for dense linear algebra.

### Frontier Applications

Despite computational costs, GA enables novel visual computing approaches:

**Neural Implicit Representations**: NeRF and related techniques learn continuous 3D representations. GA provides:
- Unified ray-surface intersection for arbitrary implicit surfaces
- Natural handling of oriented features (surface normals as bivectors)
- Differentiable geometric operations without special cases

**Light Field Rendering**: 4D ray space naturally maps to GA:
- Rays as bivectors (Plücker coordinates embed naturally)
- Ray-ray intersections through meet operation
- Light field transformations as versors

**Computational Photography**:
- Multi-view stereo with mixed camera types (perspective, orthographic, cross-slits)
- Unified framework for standard and exotic cameras
- Natural representation of plenoptic functions

**AR/VR Rendering**:
- Consistent intersection testing between virtual and reconstructed geometry
- Unified shadow and occlusion handling
- Portal rendering through conformal transformations

These applications typically involve offline processing or small-scale real-time systems where GA's architectural benefits outweigh performance costs.

### Engineering Guidance

GA provides value for visual computing when:
- Architectural simplicity matters more than raw performance
- Systems handle diverse geometric primitives or camera types
- Numerical robustness near degeneracies is critical
- Novel algorithms require mathematical flexibility
- Analytical solutions exist (e.g., bivector area lights)

GA cannot compete when:
- Real-time performance on large-scale data is required
- Sparse structure must be exploited (modern SLAM)
- GPU memory bandwidth is the bottleneck
- Existing optimized pipelines meet all requirements

Successful deployments use hybrid architectures:
1. GA for high-level geometric reasoning
2. Traditional methods for performance-critical operations
3. Careful data structure design to minimize conversion
4. "Shadow" GA calculations for validation during development

The bivector illumination model exemplifies GA's potential—analytical computation replacing stochastic sampling. Such alignment between mathematical structure and problem requirements justifies computational costs. Engineers must identify these "sweet spots" in their specific domains.
